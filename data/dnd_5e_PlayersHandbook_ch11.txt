This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile
of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid
within range. Your spell imbues lhe targel wilh a foul
mimicry of life, raising il as an undead crealure. The
largel becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a
zombie if you chose a corpse (lhe DM has lhe crealure's
game slalislics).
On each of your lurns, you can use a bonus aclion
lOmentally command any crealure you made with
lhis spell if lhe creature is within 60 feel of you (if you

control multi pie creatures, you can command any or all
of them at the same time, issuing the same command to
each one). Vou decide what action the creature will take
and where it will move during its next turn, or you can
issue a general command, such as to guard a particular
chamber or corridor. lf you issue no commands, the
creature only defends itself against hostile creatures.
Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it
until its task is complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours,
after which it stops obeying any command you've given
it. To maintain control of the creature for another
24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature
again before the current 24-hour period ends. This
use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four
creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than
animating a new one.
At Higher Leve/s. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th leveI or higher, you animate or reassert
contraI over two additional undead creatures for each
slot levei above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come

creature under your contrai until the spell ends or until

As a bonus action, you can mentally command any
creature you made with this spell if the creature is
within 500 feet of you (if you contrai multiple creatures,
you can command any or all of them at the same time,
issuing the same command to each one). Vou decide
what action the creature will take and where it will

command, such as to guard a particular chamber or
corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only
defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given

8th-leveI abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (IO-foot-radius sphere)
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or
iron filings)
Duration: Concentration, up to I hour
A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surraunds
you. This area is divorced fram the magical energy that
suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't
be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic
items become mundane. Unti! the spell ends, the sphere
moves with you, centered on you.
Spells and other magical effects, except those created
by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere
and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast
a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is
suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends
suppressed counts against its duration.
Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects,
such as ma(jic missi/e and charm person, that target
a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect
on that target.

Areas ofMagie. The area of another spell or magical
effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere.
If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of
the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.
For example, the liames created by a wall of fire are
suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall
if the overlap is large enough.
Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a
creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while
the creature or object is in i!.
Magie ltems. The properties and powers of
magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For
example, a +llongsword in the sphere functions as a
nonmagicallongsword.
A magic weapon's properties and powers are
suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or
wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon
or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere
(for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic
spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the
item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.
Magieal TraveI. Teleportation and planar travei
fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the
destination or the departure point for such magical
traveI. A portal to another location, world, or plane of
existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional
space such as that created by the rope trick spell,
temporarily doses while in the sphere.
Creatures and Objeets. A creature or object
summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out
of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly
reappears once the space the creature occupied is no
longer within the sphere.
Dispel Magie. Spells and magical effects such as
dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the
spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't
nullify each other.

visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side
that functions as a portal.
Any creature or object entering the portal exits from
the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each

at least 100 gp, ali of which the spell consumes)
Duration: Special
Vou and up to eight willing creatures within range
project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the
spell fails and the casting is wasted ifyou are already
on that plane). The material body you leave behind is
unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it
doesn't need food or air and doesn't age.
Your astral body resembles your mortal form in
almost every way, replicating your game statistics and
possessions. The principal difference is the addition of
a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder
blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after
1 fool. This cord is your tether to your material body. As
long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way
home. If the cord is cut-something that can happen
only when an effect specifically states that it does-your
soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.
Your astral form can freely travei through the Astral
Plane and can pass through portais there leading to any
other plane. Ifyou enter a new plane or return to the
plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and
possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing
you to re-enter your body as you ente r the new plane.
Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage
or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your
physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
The spell ends for you and your companions when
you use your action to dismiss il. When the spell ends,
the affected creature returns to its physical body,
and it awakens.
The spell might also end early for you or one of your
companions. A successful dispel magic spell used
against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that
creature. If a creature's original body or its astral form
drops to O hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If
the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls
the creature's astral form back to its body, ending its
state of suspended animation.
If you are returned to your body prematurely, your
companions remain in their astral forms and must find
their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping
to O hit points.

want it to, and then contingencyends.

aparl and creale a lrench. The trench extends across
the spell's area, and the separaled waler forms a wall lo

continues to move in the direction you chose until the
spell ends or you choose a different effect.
WhirIpooI. This effect requires a body of water
at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. Vou cause
a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The
whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the
base, up to 50 feet wide ai the top, and 25 feel tall. Any
creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the
vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim
away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics)
check against your spell save DC.
When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on
a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8
bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until
the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes
half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A crealure

Vou initially learn the surface thoughts of the

is most on its mind in that moment. As
an action, you can either shift your atlention lo another
creature's thoughts or atlempt to probe deeper into the
same creature's mind. ]f you probe deeper, the target
must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain
insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state,
and something that looms large in ils mind (such as
something it worries over, loves, or hates). ]f it succeeds,
the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are
probing into its mind, and unless you shift your atlention
to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use
its action on its turn to make an lntelligence check
contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds,
the spell ends.
Questions verbally directed at the target creature
naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell
is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
Vou make yourself-including your clothing, armor,
weapons, and other belongings on your person-Iook
different until the spell ends ar until you use your action
to dismiss it. Vou can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and
can appear thin, fat, or in belween. Vou can't change
your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the
same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent
of the illusion is up to you.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up lo
physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell
to add a hat to your oUlfit, objects pass through the hat,
and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would
feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear
thinner than you are, lhe hand of someone who reaches
out lOtouch you would bump into you while it was
seemingly still in midair.
To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use
its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed
on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save De.

This spell shapes a creature's dreams. Choose a
creature known to you as the target of this spell. The
target must be on the same plane of existence as you.
Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, can't be
contacted by this spell. Vou, or a willing creature you
touch, enlers a trance state, acting as a messenger.
While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or
her surroundings, but can't take actions or move.
If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the
target's dreams and can converse with the target as
long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the
spell. The messenger can also shape the environment
of the dream, creating landscapes. objects, and other
images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at
any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target
recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is
awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it,
and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for
the target to fali asleep, at which point the messenger
appears in the target's dreams.
Vou can make the messenger appear monstrous
and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger
can deliver a message of no more than ten words and
then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On
a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity
spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target's
sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit
from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it
takes 3d6 psychic damage.
If you have a body part, lock of hair, c1ipping from a
nail, or similar portion of the target's body, the target
makes its saving throw with disadvantage.

Each is IdlO x 10 feet deep, la feet wide, and extends
from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side.
A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens
must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fali in. A
creature that sllccessfully saves moves with the fissure's
edge as it opens.
A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to
automatically collapse (see below).
Structures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage
to any structure in contact with the ground in the area
when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your
turns until the spell ends. ]f a structure drops to Ohit
points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby
creatures. A crealure within half the distance of a
structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning
damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble,
requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an
action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher
or lower, depending on the nalure of the rubble. On

will cause the spell to end and release the target. The
condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you
choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is
reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to passo The
conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity,
or deity but otherwise must be based on observable
actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as
levei, class, or hit points.
A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast
as a 9th.level spell, targeting either the prison or the

mouth appears there so that the words appear to come

it can remain and repeat its message whenever the
trigger occurs.
The triggering circumstance can be as general or as
detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual

Vou create the image of an object, a creature, ar some
other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a
20.foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you
can see within range and lasts for the duration. lt
seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and
temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. Vou
can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a
sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a
creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a
troglodyte's stench).
As long as you are within range of the illusion, you
can use your action to cause the image to move to
any other spot within range. As the image changes
location, you can alter its appearance so that its
movements appear natural for the image. For example,
if you create an image of a creature and move it, you
can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different
sounds at different times, even making it carry on a
conversation, for example.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
iIlusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
that uses its action to examine the image can determine
that it is an iIlusion with a successfullntelligence

Vou suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence
or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures
of your choice that you can see within range and that
can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be
charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must
be worded in such a manner as to make the course of
action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab
itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do
some other obviously harmful act automatically negates
the effect of the spell.
Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, it pursues the course of action you described
to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action
can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested
activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell
ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
Vou can also specify conditions that will trigger a
special activity during the duration. For example, you
might suggest that a group of soldiers give ali their
money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn't
met before the spell ends, the activity isn't performed.
lf you or any of your companions damage a creature
affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.

Duration: 1 minute
Vou create a sound or an image of an object within
range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if

lf you create a sound, its volume can range from a
whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone
else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any
other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated
throughout the duration, or you can make discrete
sounds at different times before the spell ends.
lf you create an image of an object-such as a chair,
muddy footprints, or a small chest-it must be no larger
than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light,
smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction
with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because
things can pass through it.
lf a creature uses its action to examine the sound or
image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion
with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check
against your spell save De. If a creature discerns the
illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to
the creature.

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your
space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with
you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's
impossible to track which image is real. Vou can use
your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.
Each time a creature targets you with an attack during
the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the
attack instead targets one of your duplicates.
lf you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or
higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With
two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one
duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier.
If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A
duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it.
It ignores ali other damage and effects. The spell ends
when ali three duplicates are destroyed.
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it
relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or
if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if
you attack or cast a spell.
Vou can use your action to move your illusory double
up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and
behave in whatever way you choose.
Vou can see through its eyes and hear through its ears
as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns
as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses
to using your own, or back again. While you are using its

Casting Time: I aetion
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, 5
Duration: Coneentration, up to I minute
Vou attempt to reshape another ereature's memories.
One ereature that you ean see must make a Wisdom
saving throw. If you are fighting the ereature, it has
advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the
target beeomes eharmed by you for the duration. The
eharmed target is ineapacitated and unaware of its
surroundings, though it ean still hear you. If it takes any
damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends,
and none of the target's memories are modified.
While this eharm lasts, you ean affeet the target's
memory of an event that it experieneed within the last
24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. Vou
ean permanently eliminate ali memory of the event,
allow the target to reeall the event with perfeet c!arity
and exaeting detail, ehange its memory of the details of
the event, or ereate a memory of some other event.
Vou must speak to the target to deseribe how
its memories are affeeted, and it must be able to
understand your language for the modified memories to
take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your
description. If the spell ends before you have fin ished
describing the modified memories, the creature's
memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories
take hold when the spell ends.
A modified memory doesn't neeessarily affect how a
creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts
the creature's natural inc!inations, alignment, or beliefs.
An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a
memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing
itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The
DM might deem a modified memory toa nonsensical to
affect a creature in a significant manner.
A remove eurse or greater restoration spell cast on the
target restores the creature's true memory.
At Higher LeveIs. If you east this spell using a spell
slot of 6th leveI or higher, you can alter the target's
memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago
(6th levei), 30 days ago (7th levei), I year ago (8th levei),
or any time in the creature's past (9th levei).

in ghostly liames that cause searing pain, and it must
make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2dlO radiant

damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a

A shapechanger makes its saving throw with
disadvantage. Ir it fails, it also instantly reverts to its

create a phantasmal object, creature. or other visible
phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a
lO-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target
for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead
ar constructs.
The phantasm includes sound, temperature. and other
stimuli, also evident only to the creature.
The target can use its action to examine the phantasm
with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes
that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.
While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats
the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes
any illogical outcomes from interacting with the
phantasm. For example. a target attempting to walk
across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls
once it steps anta the bridge. ]f the target survives the
fali, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up
with some other explanation for its fall-it was pushed,
it slipped, ar a strong wind might have knocked it off.
An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's
reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A
phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the
target. Similarly. a phantasm created to appear as tire. a
pool of acid. ar lava can burn the target. Each round on
your turn. the phantasm can deal Id6 psychic damage
to the target if it is in the phantasm's area ar within 5
feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a
creature ar hazard that could logically deal damage.
such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage
as a type appropriate to the illusion.

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on
the ground in an unoccupied space ofyour choice
within range. Vou decide the creature's appearance,
but it is equipped with a saddle, bit. and bridle. Any
of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a
puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away
from the steed.
For the duration, you or a creature you choose can
ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a
riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can
travei 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace.
When the spell ends. the steed gradually fades. giving
the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use
an action to dismiss it ar if the steed takes any damage.
PLANARALLY

6th-leveI conjuration
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Vou beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being
must be known to you: a god. a primordial, a demon
prince, ar some other being of cosmic power. That entity
sends a celestial, an elemental. ar a fiend loyal to it to
aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied
space within range. Ifyou know a specific crcature's
name. you can speak that name when you cast this spell
to request that creature, though you might get a different
creature anyway (DM's choice).
When the creature appears. it is under no compulsion
to behave in any particular way. Vou can ask the
creature to perform a service in exchange for payment,
but it isn't obligcd to do so. The rcquested task could
range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or hclp us
fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies. or protect

us during our foray into the dungeon). Vou must be
abJe to communicate with the creature to bargain for
its services.
Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might
require a sizable donation of gold ar magic items to
an allied temple. while a fiend might demand a living
sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might
exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.
As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in
minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A
task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And
a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10.000
gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on
the circumstances under which you cast the spel!. If the
task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment
might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks
typically require only half the suggested payment, while
especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift.
Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicida!'
After the creature completes the task, or when the
agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature
returns to its home plane after reporting back to you.
if appropriate to the task and if possible. ]f you are
unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the
creature immediately returns to its home plane.
A creature enlisted to join your group counts as
a member of it, receiving a full share of experience
points awarded.

(Typically. the creature is first summoned into the center
of an inverted magie eircle in arder to keep it trapped
while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting,
the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a
failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If
the creature was summoned ar created by another spell.
that spell's duration is extended to match the duration
of this spel!.
A bound creature must follow your instructions to the
best of its ability. Vou might command the creature to
accompany you on an adventure. to guard a location. or
to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of
your instructions. but if the creature is hostil e to you. it
strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives.
]f the creature carries out your instructions completely
before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact
if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a
different plane of existence. it returns to the place where
you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

This spell allows you to change the appearance of any
number of creatures that you can see within range. Vou
give each target you choose a new, iIIusory appearance.
An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw,
and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.
The spell disguises physical appearance as well as
clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. Vou can make
each creature se em I foot shorter or taller and appear
thin, fat, or in between. Vou can't change a target's body
type, so you must choose a form that has the same
basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of
the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration,
unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to
physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell
to add a hat to a creature's outtit, objects pass through
the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing
or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use

divination spells.
If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of
suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it
doesn't grow older.
Vou can set a condition for the spell to end early.

Vou assume the form of a different creature for the
duration. The new form can be of any creature with
a challenge rating equal to your leveI or lower. The

creature can't be a construct or an undead, and you
must have seen the sort of creature at least once. Vou
transform into an average example of that creature, one
without any c1ass leveis or the Spellcasting trait.
Vour game statistics are replaced by the statistics
of the chosen creature, though you retain your
alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
scores. Vou also retain ali of your skill and saving
throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the
creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you
and the bonus Iisted in its statistics is higher than yours,
use the creature's bonus in place of yours. Vou can't use
any legendary actions or lair actions of the new formo
Vou assume the hit points and Hit Dice ofthe new
formo When you revert to your normal form, you
return to the number of hit points you had before you
transformed. ]f you revert as a result of dropping to
O hit points, any excess damage carries over to your
normal formo As long as the excess damage doesn't
reduce your normal form to O hit points, you aren't
knocked unconscious.
Vou retain the benefit of any features from your c1ass,
race, or other source and can use them, provided that
your new form is physically capable of doing so. Vou
can't use any special senses you have (for example,
darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense.
Vou can only speak if the creature can normally speak.
When you transform, you choose whether your
equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new
form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as
normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for
the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on
the creature's shape and size. Vour equipment doesn't
change shape or size to match the new form, and any
equipment that the new form can't wear must either fali
to the ground or merge into your new formo Equipment
that merges has no effect in that state.
During this spell's duration, you can use your action to
assume a different form following the same restrictions
and rules for the original form, with one exception; if
your new form has more hit points than your current
one, your hit points remain at their current value.

accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.
Vou can use your action to cause the image to move to
any spot within range. As the image changes location,
you can alter its appearance so that its movements
appear natural for the image. For example, if you create
an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the
image so that it appears to be walking.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
that uses its action to examine the image can determine
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence

can see through the image.

It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half
the creature's hit point maximum and is formed without

The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you
designa te. It obeys your spoken commands, moving
and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting
on your turo in combat. The simulacrum lacks the
ability to learo or beco me more powerful, so it never
increases its levei or other abilities, nor can it regain
expended spell slots.

worth 100 gp per hit poim it regains. The simulacrum

least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph
either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or
a table) or within an object that can be c10sed to conceal
the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest).
]f you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of
the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you
choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if
the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you
cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends
without being triggered.
The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence
(lnvestigation) check against your spell save
DC to find it.
Vou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the
spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical
triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph,
removing another object covering it, approaching within
a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object
that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object,
the most common triggers are opening the object,
approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or
reading the glyph.
Vou can further refine the trigger so the spell is
activated only under certain circumstances or according
to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height
or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could
be set to affect hags or shapechangers). Vou can also
specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as
those who say a certain password.
When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the
options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph
glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim Iight
for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each
creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is
targcted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the
sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

throw, taking IOdlO necrotic damage on a failed save, or

300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground,
Vou allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to
regain ali hit points, and you end ali effects on them
described in the greater restoration spel!.
Vou grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.
Vou grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to
a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For
instance, you could make yourself and ali your companions immune to a Iich's Iife drain attack.
Vou undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of
any roll made within the last round (including your
last tum). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the
new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an
opponent's successful save, a foe's criticai hit, or a
friend's failed save. Vou can force the reroll to be made
with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose
whether to use the reroll or the original roll.
Vou might be able to achieve something beyond the
scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM
as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in
ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the
wish, the greater the Iikelihood that something goes
wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire
might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some
unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded
the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead
might propel you forward in time to a period when that
villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from
the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item
or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence
of the item's current owner.
The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect
other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After
enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until
you finish a long rest, you take IdlO necrotic damage
per leveI of that spel!. This damage can't be reduced or
prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops
to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each
of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing
more than Iight activity, your remaining recovery time
decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent
chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you
suffer this stress.
