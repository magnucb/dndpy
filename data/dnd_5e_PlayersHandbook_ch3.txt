CLASSES

ARE EXTRAOROINARY

PEOPLE,

driven bya thirst for excitement into a
tife that others would never dare lead,
They are herocs, compelled to explore the
dark places of lhe world and take on lhe
challenges lhat lesser women and men
can't stand against.
Class is the primary dcfinition of what your character
can do, !t's more than a profession; it's your character's
calling. Class shapes the way you think about the
world and intcract with it and your relationship with
other people and powers in the multiverse. A fighler,
for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms
of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a
pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might
see himself as a willing servanl in a god's unfolding plan
or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the
fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army,
the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and
devotees who share his faith.

Your class gives you a variety of special features, such
as a fighter's mastery of weapons and armor, and a
wizard's spells. At low leveis, your class gives you only
two or three features, but as you advance in levei you
gain more and your existing features often improve.
Each class enlry in this chapter includes a table
summarizing the benefits you gaio at every levei, and
a detailed explanalion of each one.
Adventurers sometimes advance in more thao one
class. A rogue might switch direction in tife and swear
the oath of a paladin, A barbarian might discover latent
magical abilily and dabble in the sorcerer class while
continuing to advance as a barbarian. Elves are known
to combine martial mastery with magical training
and advance as fighters and wizards simultaneously.
Oplional rules for combining classes in this way, called
multiclassing, appear in chapter 6.
Twelve classes-tisted
in the Classes table-are found
in almost every D&D world and define lhe spectrum of
lypical adventurers.

BARBARIAN
A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard,
draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he
charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his
people's elk herdo
A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her
authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck
with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivaIs.
Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into
the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored
elbow into the gut of another.
These barbarians, different as they might be, are
defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and
unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger
is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting
assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.
For some, their rage springs from a communion
with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling
reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every
barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle
frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and
feats of strength.
PRIMAL INSTINCT
People of towns and cities take pride in how their
civilized ways set them apart from animaIs, as if
denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To
a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign
of weakness. The strong embrace their animal naturekeen instincts, primaI physicality, and ferocious rage.
Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls
and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands:
the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes
live and hunt.
Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat.
They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over,
giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A
barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few
times without resting, but those few rages are usually
sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.

A

LIFE OF DANGER

Not every member of the tribes deemed "barbarians"
by scions of civilized society has the barbarian c1ass. A
true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as
a skilled fighter in a town. and he or she plays a similar
role as a protector of the people and a leader in times
of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught
with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying

What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you
lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you
join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared
threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you
out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee?
Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to
"civilized" lands and only now able to win your freedom.
Or you might have been cast out from your people
because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated,
or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.
QUICK BUILD

monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger
so that their people don't have to.
Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians
perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a
way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of
the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some
barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the
tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds
formed among the members of their adventuring parties.

CREATING

Vou can make a barbarian quickly by following these
suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in
Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the
outlander background.

Hit Points at Higher LeveIs: ld12 (or 7) + your
Constitution modifier per barbarian leveI after 1st

A BARBARIAN

When creating a barbarian character, think about where
your character comes from and his or her place in the
world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin
for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land,
making you a stranger in the area of the campaign?
Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier
where barbarians are common?

PROFICIENCIES

Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields
Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons
Tools: None

PART 1

I

CLASSES

UNARMORED

DEFENSE

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class
equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution
modifier. Vou can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

RECKLESS ATTACK
Starting at 2nd levei, you can throw aside ali concern
for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When
you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide
to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on
melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this
turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until
your next turno

DANGER SENSE
At 2nd levei, you gain an uncanny sense of when things
nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge
when you dodge away from danger.
Vou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws
against effects that you can see, sue h as traps and spells.
To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or
incapacitated.

PRIMAL PATH
At 3rd levei. you choose a path that shapes the nature of
your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path
of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the
c1ass description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd
levei and agaln at 6th, 10th, and 14th leveis.

ABILITY

SCORE IMPRovEMENT

When you reach 4th levei, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th levei, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.

EXTRA ATTACK
Beginning at 5th levei, you can attack twice, instead of
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turno

FAST MOVEMENT
Starting at 5th levei, your speed increases by 10 feet
while you aren't wearing heavy armor.

FERAL INSTINCT
By 7th levei, your instincts are so honed that you have
advantage on initiative rolls.
Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of
combat and aren't incapacitated. you can act normally
on your first turn, but only ifyou enler your rage before
doing anything else on that turno

BRUTAL CRITICAL
Beginning at 9th levei, you can roll one additional
weapon damage die when determining the extra
damage for a criticai hit with a melee attack.
This increases to two additional dice at 13th levei
and three additional dice at 17th leveI.

RELENTLESS

RAGE

Starting at 11th levei, your rage can keep you fighting
despite grievous wounds. lf you drop to O hit points
while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make
a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. lfyou succeed. you
drop to 1 hit point inslead.
Each time you use this feature after the first. the DC
increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the
DC resets to 10.

PERSISTENT

barbarians attribute their rage to different sources,
however. For some, it is an internai reservoir where
pain. grief. and anger are forged into a fury hard as
steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing. a gift of
a totem animal.

PATH OF THE BERSERKER
For some barbarians. rage is a means to an end-that
end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path
of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter
the berserker's rage. you thrill in the chaos of battle,
heedless of your own health or well-being.
FRENZY

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd levei. you
can go inlo a frenzy when you rage. lf you do so. for
the duration of your rage you can make a single melee
weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns
after this one. When your rage ends. you suffer one levei
of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).

choose to end il.

INDOMITABLE

check is less than your Strength score, you can use that
score in place of the total.

a creature that is within 5 fcet of YOII.you can usc
your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against
that creature.
PATH OF THE TOTEM WARRIOR
The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journcy, as
the harharian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protcctor,
and inspiration. In battle. your totem spirit fills you
with supernatural might. adding magiral fuel to your
barharian rage.
Most harharian tribes consider a totem animal to bc
kin to a particular elan. [n such cases. it is unusual for
an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit,
though exceptions exisl.

At 6th leveI. you gain a magical benefit based on the
totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same
animal you selected at 3rd levei or a different one.

(Perception) checks.
Wolf. You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You
can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace,
and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal
pace (see ,hapter 8 for rules on travei pace).

BARD
Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient
monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged
leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind,
conjured forth by the magic of her song-knowledge
of the people who constructed the monument and the
mythic saga it depicts.
A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically
against his scale mai!, setting the tempo for his war chant
and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroismo
The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.
Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves
her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring
that her companions' words will be well received.
Whether scholar, skald, ar scoundrel, a bard weaves
magic through words and music to inspire allies,
demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create
illusions, and even heal wounds.

MUSIC AND MAGIC
In the worlds of 0&0, words and music are
not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with
power ali their own. The bard is a master of song,
speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say
that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the
words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these
primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout
the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch
and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their
spells and powers.
The greatest strength of bards is their sheer
versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines
in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and
hinder their foes fram a distance. But bards are capable
of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using
their magic to bolster their swords and armar. Their
spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than
blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging
knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude
that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become
masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting,
from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.

LEARNING

FROM EXPERIENCE

True bards are not common in the world. Not every
minstrel singing in a tavern ar jester cavorting in a royal
court is a bardo Oiscovering the magic hidden in music
requires hard study and some measure of natural talent
that most traubadours and jongleurs lack. lt can be hard
to spot the difference between these performers and true
bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering acrass
the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the
gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer.
But a depth of knowledge, a leveI of musical skill, and a
touch of magic set bards apart fram their fellows.
Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and
their natural desire to traveI-to find new tales to tell,
new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the
horizon-makes
an adventuring career a natural calling.
Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a
variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost

QUICK

BUILD

You can make a bard quickly by
following these suggestions. First,
Charisma should be your highest
ability score, followed by Dexterity.
Second, choose the entertainer
background. Third, choose the dancing Jights and
vicious mockery cantrips, along with the following
1st-leveI spells: charm person, detect magic, heaJing

As a bard, you gain the following class features.

works of magic, decipher old tomes, traveI to strange
places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to
accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A
bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal
experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed,
after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing
mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart
and assume heroic roles themselves.

CREATING

A BARD

Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true
or not. Your character's background and motivations
are not as important as the stories that he or she tells
about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane
childhood. There's no good story to be told about that,
so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag
in a dismal swamp. ar your childhood might be worthy
of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music
through extraordinary means, including the inspiration
of fey or other supernatural creatures.
Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a
mas ter, following the more experienced bard until you
were ready to strike out on your own? ar did you attend
a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced
your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway
or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became
your mentor. ar you might have been a spoiled noble
child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the
clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in
addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?

COLLEGE

OF LORE

Bards Dfthe College of Lore know something about
most things, collecting bits Dfknowledge from sources
as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales.
Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate
compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts
to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies
down, the audience members might find themselves
questioning everything they held to be true, from their
faith in the priesthood of the localtemple to their
loyalty to the king.
The loyalty Dfthese bards Iies in the pursuit Dfbeauty
and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the
tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a
herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be
honest than politic.
The college's members gather in libraries and
sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms
and dormitories, to share their lore with one another.
They also meet at festivaIs or affairs of state, where they
can expose corruption, unravellies, and poke fun at selfimportant figures of authority.

PART 1

C.LASSF.S

CLERIC
Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer
on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that
spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.
Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe
in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs
arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with
every foe's falI.
Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a
human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to
drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.
Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world
and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods
they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of
their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with
divine magic.

HEALERS AND WARRIORS
Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of
the gods, lIowing from them into the world. Clerics are
conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous
effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who
seeks it, but only to those chosen to fuIfi11a high calling.
Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or
training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and
ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on
devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.
Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and
inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder
foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of
plague or poison, and even call down liames from heaven
to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will
benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on
their combat training to let them wade into melee with
the power of the gods on their side.

DIVINE AGENTS
Not every acolyte or officiant at a tem pIe or shrine is a
cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple
service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and
sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some
cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed
as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and
involving no communion with a god at alI. True clerics
are rare in most hierarchies.
When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually
because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals
of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the
walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in
ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect

Vou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available

one spell). The spells must be of a leveI for which you
have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 3rd-Ievel c1eric, you have four
1st-levei and two 2nd-levei spell slots. With a Wisdom

of 1st or 2nd levei, in any combination. ]f you prepare

and water-must remain in equilibrium. If one element
were to gain power over the others, the world could be
destroyed, drawn into one of the eJemental planes and
broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids
oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote
one element to the exclusion of others.
Druids are also concerncd with the deJicate ecological
balance that sustains plant and animallife, and the need
for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in
opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in
nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including
aberrations (such as beholders and mind f1ayers)
and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids
sometimes lead raids against such creatures, espccially
when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.
Druids arc often found guarding sacred sites or
watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a
significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance
or the lands they protecl, druids take on a more active
role in combating the threal, as adventurers.
CREATING

A DRUID

When making a druid, consider why your character has
such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character
lives in a society where the Old Faith slill thrives, or was
raised bya druid after being abandoned in the depths
of a forcst. Perhaps your character had a dramatic
encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to
face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving lhe
experience. Maybe your character was born during an
epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreled

as a sign that becoming a druid
was part of your character's destiny.
Have you aJways been an adventurer
as part of your druidic calling, or did you
first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred
grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was
befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in
hopes of finding a new home or purpose.

SACREO PLANTS ANO WOOO

Adruid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularlyalder,
ash, birch,elder, hazel, holly,juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan,
willow,and yew.Druids often use such plants as part of a
spellcastíng focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yewor
sprigs of mistletoe.
Similarly,a druid uses such woods to make other objects,
such as weapons and shields. Yewis assocíated wíth death
and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might
be fashioned from il. Ash is assocíated with lifeand oak
with strength. These woods make excellenthafts or whole

Alderis assocíated wíth air,and it might be used for thrown

2nd levei, for example, you can transform into any beast
that has a challenge rating of 1(4 ar lower that doesn't
have a f1yingar swimming speed,

Vou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours
eqllalto halfyollr drllid levei (rollnded down). YOllthen
revert to your normal form unless you expend another
use of this feature. Vou can revert to your normal
form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn, Vou
automatically revert if YOllfali unconscious, drop to
O hit points, or die.
While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

Vour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of
the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality,
and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Vou
also retain ali of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If
the creature has the same proficiency as you and the
bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the
creature's bonus instead of yours. lf the creature has
any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
When you transform, you assume the beast's hit
points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal
form, you return to the number of hit points you had
before you transformed. However, if you rever! as a
result of dropping to O hit points, any excess damage
carries over to your normal formo For example, if you
take lO damage in animal form and have only 1 hit
point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as
the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form
to O hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
Vou can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or
take any action that requires hands is limited to the
capabilities of your beast formo Transforming doesn't
break your concentration on a spell you've already
cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that
are part of a spell, such as caJl Jightning, that you've
already cast.
Vou retain the benefit of any features from your class,
race, or other source and can use them if the new
form is physically capable of doing so. However, you
can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
Vou choose whether your equipment falls to the
ground in your space, merges into your new form, or
is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal,
but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new
form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Vour equipment doesn't change
size or shape to match the new
form, and any equipment that
the new form can't wear
must either fali to the
ground or merge with it.
Equipment that merges
with the form has no
effect until you leave
the formo

DRUID CIRCLE
At 2nd levei, you choose to
identify with a circle of druids:
the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both
detailed at the end of the class description. Vour choice
grants you features at 2nd levcl and again at 6th, 10th,
and 14th leveI.

ABILITY

SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th levei, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th leveI, you can increase one ability score of
your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores
of your choicc by 1. As normal, you can't increase an
ability score above 20 using this feature.

TIMELESS BODY
Starting at 18th leveI, the primaI magic that you wield
causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that
pass, your body ages only 1 year.

BEAST SPELLS
Beginning at 18th leveI, you can cast many of your druid
spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. Vou
can perform the somatic and verbal components of a
druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to
provide material components.

ARCHDRUID
At 20th levei, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited
number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic
components of your druid spells, as well as any material
components that lack a cost and aren't consumed bya
spell. Vou gain this benefit in both your normal shape
and your beast shape from Wild Shape,

DRUID

CIRCLES

Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders,
druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring
political borders, Ali druids are nominally members
of this druidic society, though some individuais are so
isolaled lhat lhey have never seen any high-ranking
members of the society or participated in druidic
gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and
sislers, Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids
somelimes compete with or even prey on each other,
At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that
share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the
way of the druid,

CIRCLE

OF THE LAND

The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages
who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through
a vast oral tradition, These druids meet within sacred
circles of trees or standing slones to whisper primai
secrets in Druidic, The circle's wisest members preside
as the chief priests of communities lhat hold to the Old
Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk,
As a member of this circle, your magic is inl1uenced
by the land where you were initiated into the circle's
mysterious rites.

magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing
with nature, During a short rest, you choose expended
spell slots to recover. The spell slols can have a
combined levei that is equal to or less lhan half your
druid levei (rounded up), and none of the slots can be
6th levei or higher. Vou can't use this feature again until
you finish a long rest
For example, when YOllare a 4th-levei druid, YOllcan
recover up to two leveis worth of spell slots, Vou can
recover either a 2nd-levei slot or two 1sI-leveI slots,

PRIMAL STRIKE

Starting at 6th levei, moving through nonmagical
difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. Vou can
also pass through nonmagical plants without being
slowed by them and without taking damage from them if
they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against
plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede
movement, such those created by the entangle spell.

Starting at 6th levei, your attacks in beast form eount as
magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and
immunity to nonmagieal attaeks and damage.

At 10th levei, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape
at the same time to transform into an air elemental, an
earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.

ELEMENTAL WILD SHAPE

NATURE'S WARD

THOUSAND

When you reach 10th levei, you can't be charmed or

poison and disease.

By 14th levei, you have learned to use magie to alter
your physical form in more subtle ways. Vou can cast the
alter self spell at will.

NATURE'S

••

SANCTUARY

When you reach 14th levei, creatures of the natural
world sense your connection to nature and become
hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature
attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving
throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save,
the creature must choose a different target, or the attack
automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature
is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its
attack against you.

CIRCLE OF THE MOON
Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians
of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to
share news and trade warnings. They haunt thc deepest
parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks
on end before crossing paths with another humanoid
creature, let alone another druid.
Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might
prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops
as an eagle the next day, and crash through the
undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing
monster. The wild is in the druid's blood.
COMBAT WILD SHAPE

When you choose this circle at 2nd levei, you gain the
ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action,
rather than as an action.
Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild
Shape. you can use a bonus action to expend one
spell slot to regain ld8 hit points per levei of the spell
slot expended.

DRUIOS

FORMS

•••
ANO THE COOS

Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but
most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities
worshiped in the multiverse (the Iists of gods in appendix
B inelude many such deities). The worship ofthese deities
is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths
of elerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of
Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it
elaims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers,
and others who live elosely with nature. This tradition
ineludes the worship of Nature as a primai force beyond
personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory,
the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees ofObad.Hai, Ehlonna,
and Ulaa.
In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms,
druidic cireles are not usually connected to the faith of a
single nature deity. Any given cirele in the Forgotten Realms,
for example, might inelude druids who revere Silvanus,
Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury:
Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are
often called the First Cirele, the first among the druids, and
most druids count them ali (even the violent ones) as worthy
af veneration.

The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely
unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of
the other religions of the world. They believe that every living
thing and every natural phenomenon-sun,
moon, wind,
fire, and the world itself-has
a spiri!. Their spells, then, are
a means to communicate with and command these spirits.
Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies
about the pro per relationship of these spirits to each other
and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example,
believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature,

the Children ofWinter venerate the forces of death, and the
Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the
world from the incursion of aberrations.

CIRCLE FORMS

The rites ofyour circle grant you the ability to transform
into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd
levei, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a
beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore
the Max. CR eolumn of the Beast Shapes table, but must
abide by the other limitations there).
Starting at 6th levei, you can transform into a beast
with a challenge rating as high as your druid leveI
divided by 3, rounded down.

FIGHTER
A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield
before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An
elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers
the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisitc
bow. The half-orc nearby shouls orders, helping
lhe lwo combalanls coordinate their assault to the
best advantage.
A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between
the ogre's club and his companion, knocking the dcadly
blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor,
swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles
the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.
A gladiator fighls for sport in an arena, a master with
his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving
them around for the crowd's delight-and his own
tactical advantage. His opponent's sword fiares with
blue light an instant beforc she sends lightning fiashing
forth to smite him.
Ali of these heroes are fighlers, perhaps the most
diverse class of characters in the worlds of DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS. Questing knighls, conquering overlords, royal
champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries,
and bandit kings-as fighters, they ali share an
unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a
thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they
are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and
staring it defiantly in lhe face.
WELL-RoUNDED

SPECIALISTS

Fighters learn the basics of ali combat styles. Every
fighter can swing an axe, fence wilh a rapier, wield a
longsword or a grealsword, use a bow, and even trap foes
in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighler is
adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that
basic degree of familiarity, each fighler specializes in a
cerlain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery,
some on fighting with two weapons aI once, and some
on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This
combination of broad general ability and extensive
specialization makes fighters superior combatants
on battlefields and in dungeons alike.

Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as
adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and
other dangerous work common among adventurers is
second nature for a fighter, not ali that different from
the life he ar she left behind. There are greater risks,
perhaps, but also much greater rewards-few fighters in
the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic
flame tongue sword, for example.

CREATING A FIGHTER
As you build your fighter, think about two related
elements ofyour character's background: Where did
you get your combat training, and what set you apar!
from the mundane warriors around you? Were you
particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a
mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication?
What drove you to this training in the first place? A
threat to your homeland, a thirsl for revenge, ar a need
to prove yourself might ali have been factors.
Vou might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's
army ar in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war
academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history.
Or you mighl be self-taught-unpolished
but well tested.
Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits
of life on a farm, ar are you following a proud family
tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and
armar? They might have been military issue ar family
heirlooms. ar perhaps you scrimped and saved for years

to buy them. Your armaments are now among your
most important possessions-the
only things that stand
between you and death's embrace.
QUICK BUILD

Vou can make a fighter quickly by following these
suggestions. first, make Strength ar Dexterity your
highest ability score, depending on whether you
want to focus on melee weapons ar on archery (ar
finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be
Constitution, ar Intelligence if you plan to adopt the
Eldritch Knight martial archetype. Second, choose
the soldier background.

BATTLE MASTER
Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master
employ martial techniques passed down through
generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic
field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such
as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter
absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry
that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but
those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill
and knowledge.

ELDRITCH

KNIGHT

The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial
mastery common to ali fighters with a careful study of
magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar
to those practiced by wizards, They focus their study

on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and
evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight
additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal
damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's
reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively
small number of spells, committing them to memory
instead of keeping them in a spellbook.
SPELLCASTING

When you reach 3rd levei, you augment your martial
prowess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10
for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for
the wizard spelllist.
Cantrips. Vou learn two cantrips of your choice fram
the wizard spell list. Vou learn an additional wizard
cantrip of your choice at 10th leveI.
SpeJl Slots. The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table
shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
spells of 1st leveI and higher. To cast one of these
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's levei or
higher. Vou regain ali expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the Ist.level spell shieId and
have a Ist.level and a 2nd.level spell slot available, you
can cast shieId using either slot.
SpeJls Known of 1st-LeveI and Higher. Vou know
three 1st.level wizard spells of your choice, two of which
you must choose from the abjuration and evocation
spells on the wizard spelllist.
The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight
Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard
spells of 1st levei or higher. Each of these spells must be
an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must
be of a leveI for which you have spell slots. For instance,
when you reach 7th levei in this c1ass, you can learn one
new spell of 1st or 2nd leveI.
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th leveI can
come from any school of magic.
Whenever you gain a leveI in this c1ass, you can
replace one of the wizard spells you know with another
spell of your choice from lhe wizard spelllist. The
new spell must be of a leveI for which you have spell
slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell,
unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th,
or 20th leveI.
Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting
ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your
spells through study and memorization. Vou use your
lntelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier
when setting lhe saving throw De for a wizard spell you
cast and when making an attack roll with one.

MONASTIC

ORDERS

lhe worlds of D&D contain a multitude of monasteries
and monastic traditions. In lands with an Asian cultural
flavor, such as Shou Lung far to the east of the Forgotten
Realms, these monasteries are associated with philosophical
traditions and martial arts practice. lhe Iron Hand School,
the Five Stars School, the Northern Fist School, and
the Southern Star School ofShou Lung teach different
approaches to the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines
of the monk. Some of these monasteries have spread to the
western lands of FaerOn, particularly in places with large
Shou immigrant communities. such as lhesk and Westgate.
Other monastic traditions are associated with deities who
teach the value of physical excellence and mental discipline.
In the Forgotten Realms, the order ofthe Dark Moon is
made up of monks dedicated to Shar (goddess of loss), who
maintain secret communities in remote hills, back allies,
and subterranean hideaways. Monasteries of IImater (god
of endurance) are named after flowers, and their orders
carry the names of great heroes of the faith; the Disciples of
Saint Sollars the lwice-Martyred reside in the Monastery of
the Yellow Rose near Damara. lhe monasteries of Eberron
combine the study of martial arts with a life of scholarship.
Most are devoted to the deities of the Sovereign Hosl.
In the world of Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to
Majere, god of meditation and thoughl. In Greyhawk, many
monasteries are dedicated to Xan Yae, the goddess of twilight
and the superiority of mind over matter, or to Zuoken, god of
mental and physical mastery.
lhe evil monks ofthe Scarlet Brotherhood in the world of
Greyhawk derive their fanatic zeal not from devotion to a god
but from dedication to the principies oftheir nation and their
race-the belief that the Suei strand of humanity are meant
to rule the world .

PALADIN
Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite
the dust and grime of long travei, a human lays down
her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally
wounded mano Divine radiance shines from her hands,
the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide
with amazement.
A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak
making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches
an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently,
he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two
orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.
Silver hair shining in a shaft of !ight that seems to
illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His
spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again
at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its
hideous darkness.
Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are
united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil.
Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of
a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey
beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the
dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful
bond. lt is a source of power that turns a devout warrior
into a blessed champion.

THE CAUSE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness,
to stand with the good things of the world against the
encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil
wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various
aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are
bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their
sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to
gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a
commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.
Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat,
mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so,
their martial skills are secondary to the magical power
they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite
the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent
and those who join them in the fight for justice.

evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the
militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people
can c1aim the true calling of a paladin. When they do
receive the call, these warriors turn from their former
occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes
their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as
leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their
loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to
crown and country.
Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A
delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest
driven bya higher purpose than the acquisition of
treasure. Evillurks in dungeons and primeval forests,
and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the
cosmic balance away from oblivion.

CREATING

Lay on Hands

A PALADIN

The most important aspect of a paladin character is
the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the c1ass
features related to your oath don't appear until you
reach 3rd levei, plan ahead for that choice by reading
the oath descriptions at the end of the c1ass. Are you a
devoted servant of good. loyal to the gods of justice and
honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth
to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light,
cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the
shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions
older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered
loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done
great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven
by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists many deities
worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such

as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous,
Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, DoI
Arrah, the Silver Flame,
Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty,
and Heimdall.
How did you experience your call to
serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper
from an unseen god or angel while you were at
prayer? Did another paladin sense the potentia! within
you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some
terrible event-the destruction of your home, perhapsdrive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into
a sacred grove or a hidden eIven enclave and found
yourself called to protect ali such refuges of goodness
and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest
memories that the paladin's life was your calling, almost
as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose
stamped on your soul.
As guardians against the forces of wickedness,
paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them
walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your
alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest
and the manner in which you conduct yourself before
gods and mortaIs. Your oath and alignment might be
in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of
behavior that you have not yet attained.

DIVINE

SENSE

The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like
a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly
music in your ears. As an action, you can open your
awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your
next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend,
or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total
cover. Vou know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of
any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity

neutralize one poison affecting it. Vou can cure multi pIe
diseases and neutralize multi pIe poisons with a single
use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately
for each one.
This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

FIGHTING

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with
two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new
roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile
property for you to gain this benefit.
PROTECTION

When a creature you can see attacks a target other
than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your
reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.
Vou must be wielding a shield.

SPELLCASTING
By 2nd levei, you have learned to draw on divine
magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as
a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell listo
PREPARING

AND CASTING

SPELLS

The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of
1st leveI or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's
leveI or higher. Vou regain ali expended spell slots when
you finish a long resto
Vou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available
for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spelllist.
When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells
equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin
leveI, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells
must be of a leveI for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 5th-leveI paladin, you have
four 1st-leveI and two 2nd-leveI spell slots. With a
Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include
four spells of 1st or 2nd levei, in any combination. If you
prepare the 1st-levei spell cure wounds, you can cast
it using a 1st-leveI or a 2nd-leveI slot. Casting the spell
doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
Vou can change your list of prepared spells when you
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least I
minute per spelllevel for each spell on your list.
SPELLCASTING

ABILITY

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin
spells, since their power derives from the strength of

your convictions. Vou use your Charisma whenever a
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you

throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making
an attack roll with one.

than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases
by ld8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.

HEALTH

By 3rd levei, the divine magic flowing through you
makes you immune to disease.

SACRED OATH
When you reach 3rd leveI, you swear the oath that binds
you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been
in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not
yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion,
the Oath of the Ancients, ar the Oath of Vengeance, all
detailed at the end of the c1ass description.
Your choice grants you features at 3rd leveI and again

access to these spells at the leveIs specified in the oath
description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you

SACRED OATHS
Becorning a paladin invoIves taking vows that commit
the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active
path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken
when he ar she reaches 3rd levei, is the culmination
of ali the paladin's training. Some characters with this
c1ass don't consider themselves true paladins until
they have reached 3rd levei and made this oath. For
others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality,
an official stamp on what has always been true in the
paladin's heart.

OATH OF DEVOTION
The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest
ideaIs of justice, virtue, and arder. Sometimes called
cavaliers, white knights. ar holy warriors, these
paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armar.

acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater
good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of
conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of
the world to the same standards. Many who swear this
oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their
gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold
angels-the perfect servants of good-as their ideaIs,
and incorporate images of angelic wings into their
helmets or coats of arms.
TENETS OF DEVOTION

Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of
Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.
Honesty. Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be
your promise.
Coural1e. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.
Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and
punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your
foes, but temper it with wisdom.
Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your
honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as
much good as possible while causing the least
amount ofharm.
Duty. Be responsible for your actions and their
consequences, protect those entrusted to your care,
and obey those who have just authority over you.

BREAKING

YOUR

OATH

••

A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct,
but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes
the right path proves toa demanding, sometimes a situation
calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of
emotion causes a paladin to transgress his ar her oath.
A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution
fram a eleric who shares his ar her faith ar from another
paladin of the same arder. The paladin might spend an ali.
night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, ar undertake a
fast ar similar act of self.denia!. After a rite of confession and
forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.
If a paladin willfully violates his ar her oath and shows no
sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious.
At the DM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be
forced to abandon this elass and adopt another, ar perhaps
to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the

Dungeon Master's Cuide.

nat necessarily because they believe in principIes of
hanor, caurage, and justice. They adorn their armor and
clothing with images of growing things-Ieaves, antlers,
or flowers-to reflect their commitment to preserving
life and light in the world.
TENETS OF THE ANCIENTS

The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been
preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath
emphasizes the principies of good above any concerns
of law or chaos. Its faur central principies are simple.

symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that
can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it
takes damage.
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly
move to a space within 30 feet of you. lt also can't take
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action
or try to escape fram an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use
the Dodge action.
If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion,
shapeshifting, or other effect, lhat form is revealed while
it is turned.
AURA OF WARDING

Beginning at 7th leveI, ancient magic lies so heavily
upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. Vou and friendly
creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to
damage from spells.
At 18th leveI, the range of this aura increases to 30 feel.
Kindle the Light. Through your acts of mercy,
kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the
world, beating back despair.
Shelter the Light. Where there is good, beauty, love,
and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness
that would swallow il. Where life fiourishes, stand
against the forces that would render it barren.
Preserve Your Own Light. Delight in song and
laughter, in beauty and arl. If you allow the light to die in
your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.
Be the Light. Be a glorious beacon for ali who live in
despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth
in ali your deeds.

after another.
After tumbling away from a cone of
freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws

from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends
one arrow after another to find the gaps between the
dragon's thick scales.
Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk
that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his

DEADLY HUNTERS
Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in
hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of
civilization-humanoid
raiders, rampaging beasts and
monstrasities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They
learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving
stealthily thraugh the wilds and hiding lhemselves in
brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training
on techniques that are particularly useful against their
specific favored foes.
Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers
acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's
power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their
combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt.
A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly
focus on the grim task of protecting lhe borderlands.

Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a
guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend
the outskirts of civilization fram lhe ravages of monsters
and humanoid hordes lhat press in from the wild. In
some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join
forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are
independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a
dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be lhe
first-and possibly the last-line of defense.
This fierce independence makes rangers well suited
to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far
fram the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced

that they offer?

mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion.
But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can
carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's
foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might
not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in
the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.

CREATING

A RANGER

As you create your ranger character, consider the nature
of the training that gave you your particular capabilities.
Did you train with a single mentor, wandering lhe wilds
together until you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you
leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slainperhaps by the same kind of monster that became your
favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as
part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle,
trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. Vou
might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat
skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature
through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.
What's the source of your particular hatred of a
certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone
you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see
toa much of lhe destruction these monsters cause and
commit yourself to reining in their depredations? [s
your adventuring career a continuation of your work
in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change?

to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at
the end of the c1ass description. Your choice grants
you features at 3rd levei and again at 7th, 11th,
and 15th leveI.

PRIMEVAL AWARENESS

expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on
the region around you. For 1 minute per leveI of the spell
slot you expend, you can sense whether the following
types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or

bonus action on your turno AIso, you can't be tracked by

you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a
creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't
impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against il.

creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the
creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't
blinded or deafened.

FOE SLAYER
At 20th levei, you become an unparalleled hunter of your
enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your
Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of
an attack you make against one of your favored enemies.
Vou can choose to use this feature before or after the
roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

RANGER ARCHETYPES
The ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the
Hunter and the Beast Master.

HUNTER
Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your
place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors
of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter's path, you
learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats
you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of ores to
towering giants and terrifying dragons.
HUNTER'S

PREY

At 3rd levei, you gain one of the following features
of your choice.
C%ssus S/ayer. Your tenacity can wear down
the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, the creature takes an extra ld8 damage
if it's below its hit point maximum. Vou can deal this
extra damage only once per turno
Giant Ki//er. When a Large or larger creature within
5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can
use your reaction to attack that creature immediately
after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.
Horde Breaker. Once on each of your turns when you
make a weapon attack, you can make another attack
with the same weapon against a different creature that
is within 5 feet of the original target and within range
of your weapon.
DEFENSIVE

TACTICS

At 7th leveI, you gain one of the foIlowing features
of your choice.
Escape the Horde. Opportunity attacks against you
are made with disadvantage.

with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against
ali subsequent attacks made by that creature for the
rest of the turno
Stee/ Wi//. Vou have advantage on saving throws
against being frightened.
MULTIATTACK

At 11th levei, you gain one of the following features
of your choice.
Vo//ey. Vou can use your action to make a ranged
attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet
of a point you can see within your weapon's range. Vou
must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and
you make a separate attack roll for each target.
Whir/wind Attack. Vou can use your action to make a
melee attack against any number of creatures within 5
feet of you, with a separate attack roIl for each target.
SUPERIOR HUNTER'S

DEFENSE

At 15th levei, you gain one of the following features
of your choice.
Evasion. Vou can nimbly dodge out of the way of
certa in area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath
or a lightning bolt spel!. When you are subjected to an
effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw
to take only half damage, you instead take no damage

if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half
damage if you fai!'
Stand Against the Tide. When a hostile creature
misses you with a mele e attack, you can use your reaction
to force that creature to repeat the same attack against
another creature (other than itself) of your choice.
Uncanny Dodge. When an attacker that you can see
hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to
halve the attack's damage against you.

BEAST MASTER
The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship
between the civilized races and the beasts of the world.
United in focus, beast and ranger work as one to fight
the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the
wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype
means committing yourself to this ideal, working in
partnership with all animal as its companion and friend.
RANGER'S COMPANION

At 3rd levei, you gain a beast companion that
accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to
fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than
Medium and that has a chaIlenge rating of 1/4 or lower
(appendix O presellts statistics for the hawk, mastiff,
and panther as examples). Add your proficiency bonus
to the beast's AC, attack roIls, and damage rolls, as weIl
as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its
hit poinl maximum equals its normal maximum or four
times your ranger leveI, whichever is higher.
The beast obeys your commands as best as it cano It
takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn't take an
action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can
verbally command the beast where to move (no action
required by you). Vou can use your action to verbally
command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge,
or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature,
you can make one weapon attack yourself when you
command the beast to take the Attack action.
While traveling through your favored terrain with only
the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
lf the beast dies, you can obtain another one by
spending 8 hours magicaIly bonding with another beast
that isn't hostile to you, either the same type of beast as
before or a different one.
EXCEPTIONAL

TRAINING

Beginning at 7th levei, on any of your turns when
your beast companion doesn't attack, you can use a
bonus action to command the beast to take the Dash,
Disengage, Dodge, or Help action on its turno
BESTIAL FURY

Starting at 11th leveI, your beast companion can
make two attacks when you command it to use the
Attack action.
SHARE SPELLS

Beginning at 15th levei, when you cast a spell targeting
yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with
the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of YOU.

A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his
accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When
their target-a notorious slaver-passes the alleyway,

Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of
a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat
abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other
characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and
deception, while others refine the skills that help them
in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and
disarming traps, and opening locks.
When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning
over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one
precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will
hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down
with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost
supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn
magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.

SHADY LIVING

Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of
them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class,
making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and
con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized
into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues
operate independently, but even they sometimes
recruit apprentices to help them in their scams
and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as

CREATING

A ROGUE

As you create your rogue character, consider the
character's relationship to the law. Do you have a
criminal past-or present? Are you on the run from the
law or from an angry thieves' guild master? Or did you
leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger
rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures.
or some other desire or ideal?
What was the trigger that led you away from your
previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly
wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe
you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the
coin you needed to escape the squalor ofyour !ife.
Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home?
Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your
family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means
of support. Or maybe you made a new friend-another
member of your aelventuring party-who showeel you
new possibilities for earning a tiving anel employing
your particular talents.

QUICK BUILD

You can make a rogue quickly by following
these suggestions. First. Dexterity should
be your highest ability score. Make
Intelligence your next-highest if you want to
excel at Investigation or plan to take up the

interaction. Second, choose the charlatan background.

house for thieves on the run.

CUNNING

ACTION

Starting at 2nd levei, your quick thinking and agility
allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a
bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This
action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage,
or Hide action.

ROGUISH ARCHETYPE

EQUIPMENT

the equipment granted by your background:
(a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword

When you reach 4th levei, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th,
16th, and 19th levei, you can increase one ability score
of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase
an ability score above 20 using this feature.

EXPERTISE

UNCANNY

At 1st leveI, choose two ofyour skill proficiencies, or
one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with
thieves' tooIs. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
ability check you make that uses either of the chosen
proficiencies.
At 6th levei, you can choose two more of your
proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain
this benefit.

Starting at 5th levei, when an attacker that you can see
hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to
halve the attack's damage against you.

SNEAK ATTACK
Beginning at 1st levei, you know how to strike subtly
and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can
deal an extra Id6 damage to one creature you hit with
an attack if you have advantage on the attack rol!. The
attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another
enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy
isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on
the attack rol!.
The amount of the extra damage increases as you
gain leveis in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack
column of the Rogue table.

THIEVES'

CANT

During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a
secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to
hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only
another creature that knows thieves' cant understands
such messages. lt takes four times longer to convey sue h
a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and
symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such
as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a
thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the

EVASION
Beginning at 7th levei, you can nimbly dodge out of the
way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery
breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected
to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving
throw to take only half damage, you instead take no
damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only
half damage if you fai!'

RELIABLE T ALENT
By 11th levei, you have refined your chosen skills until
they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability
check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can
treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

BLINDSENSE
Starting at 14th levei, ifyou are able to hear, you are
aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature
within lO feet ofyou.

SLIPPERY MIND
By 15th leveI, you have acquired greater mental
strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

ELUSIVE
Beginning at 18th levei, you are so evasive that
attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No
attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't
incapacitated.

STROKE OF LUCK
At 20th leveI, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding
when you need to. If your attack misses a target within
range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if
you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
.Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until
you finish a short or long resto

ROGUISH ARCHETYPES
Rogues have many features in common, including their
emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and
deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick
reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in
varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes.
Vour choice of archetype is a reflection of your focusnot necessarily an indication of your chosen profession,
but a description of your preferred techniques.

THIEF
Vou hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars,
bandits, cutpurses, and other criminais typically follow
this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of
themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers,
delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your
agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into
ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using
magic items you normally couldn't employ.
FAST HANDS

Starting at 3rd leveI, you can use the bonus action
granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity
(Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to
disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an
Object action.
SECOND-STORY

WORK

When you choose this archetype at 3rd levei, you gain
the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no
longer costs you extra movement.
In addition, when you make a runningjump, the
distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal
to your Dexterity modifier.
SUPREME SNEAK

Starting at 9th levei, you have advantage on a Dexterity
(Stealth) check if you move no more than half your
speed on the same turn.

second turn at your initiative minus 10. Vou can't use
this feature when you are surprised.

ASSASSIN
Vou focus your training on the grim art of death. Those
who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers,
spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed
priests trained to exterminate the enemies of their deity.
Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your
foes with deadly efficiency.
BONUS PROFICIENCIES

When you choose this archetype at 3rd levei, you gain
proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.
ASSASSINATE

Starting at 3rd levei, you are at your deadliest when you
get the drop on your enemies. Vou have advantage on
attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn
in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against
a creature that is surprised is a criticai hit.
INFILTRATION

EXPERTISE

Starting at 9th leveI, you can unfailingly create false
identities for yourself. Vou must spend seven days and
25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations
for an identity. Vou can't establish an identity that
belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire
appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and officiallooking certification to establish yourself as a member of
a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate
yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.
Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise,
other creatures believe you to be that person until given
an obvious reason not to.
IMPOSTOR

At 13th leveI, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic
another person's speech, writing, and behavior.
Vou must spend at least three hours studying
these three components of the person's behavior,
listening to speech, examining handwriting, and
observing mannerisms.
Vour ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. Ir a
wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have
advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make
to avoid detection.
DEATH STRIKE

By 13th leveI, you have learned enough about the
workings of magic that you can improvise the use of
items even when they are not intended for YOU. Vou
ignore ali class, race, and levei requirements on the use
of magic items.

Starting at 17th leveI, you become a master of instant
death. When you attack and hit a creature that is
surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw
(DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency
bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your
attack against the creature.

at 10th leveI.
Spel1 S/ots. The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting
table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
your spells of 1st levei and higher. To cast one of these
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's leveI or
higher. Vou regain ali expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
For example. ifyou know the Ist.level spell charm
person and have a Ist.level and a 2nd.level spell slot
available, you can cast charm person using either slol.
Spel1s Known of 1st.Level and Higher. Vou know
three I st.level wizard spells of your choice, two of which
you must choose from the enchantment and iIIusion

Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard
spells of 1st levei ar higher. Each of these spells must
be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and
must be of a levei for which you have spell slots. For
instance, when you reach 7th levei in this c1ass. you can
learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd leveI.
The spells you learn at 8th. 14th, and 20th levei can
come fram any school of magic.

SORCERER
Golden eyes flashing, a human
stretches out her hand and unleashes
the dragonfire that burns in her veins.
As an inferno rages around her foes,
leathery wings spread from her back and
she takes to the air.
Long hair whipped bya conjured wind,
a half.elf spreads his arms wide and throws
his head back. Lifting him momentarily off
the ground. a wave of magic surges up in him,
through him, and out from him in a mighty blast
of lightning.
Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a
finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs
from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back
behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her
wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.
Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred
upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly
influence. or exposure to unknown cosmic forces.
One can't study sorcery as one learns a language, any
more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one
chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.

RAW MAGIe
Magic is a part of every sorcerer. suffusing body, mind,
and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped.
Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an
ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons.
Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them,
a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.
The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly
unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce
exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other
lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most
of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent
flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their
power, while others trace it to strange events in their
own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a
dryad at a baby's birth, or ataste of the water from
a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery.
So toa might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure
to the elemental forces of the [nner Planes or the
maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the
inner workings of reality.
Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient
tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on. nor do they
rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do.
By learning to harness and channel their own inborn
magic, they can discover new and staggering ways
to unleash that power.

UNEXPLAINED

POWERS

Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find
a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life
in some way. People with magical power seething in
their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like to
stay quiet. A sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded. and
it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if
it isn't called on.

Sorcerers often
have obscure or quixotic
motivations driving them
to adventure. Some seek a greater
understanding of the magical force that infuses
them, or the answer to the mystery of its origino Others
hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full
potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit
as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making
up for a compara tive lack of breadth in their magical
knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the
spells they know,

CREATING

A SORCERER

The most important question to consider when creating
your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting
character, you'lI choose an origin that ties to a draconic
bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact
source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family
curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? ar
did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with
inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?
How do you feel about the magical power coursing
through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or
revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or
a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did
you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you
had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you
feellike you've been given this power for some lofty
purpose. ar you might decide that the power gives you
the right to do what you want, to take what you want
from those who lack such power, Perhaps your power

fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spelllist.
CANTRIPS

At 1st leveI, you know four cantrips of your choice from
the sorcerer spelllist. Vou learn additional sorcerer
cantrips of your choice at higher leveis, as shown in the
Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.
SPELL SLOTS

The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your spells of 1st levei and higher. To cast
one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of
the spell's levei or higher. Vou regain ali expended spell
slots when you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-levei spell burning
hands and have a 1st-levei and a 2nd-levei spell slot
available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.
SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HWHER

Vou know two 1st-levei spells of your choice from the
sorcerer spelllist.
The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table

levei in this c1ass, you can learn one new spell of 1st
or 2nd leveI.

spelllist, which also must be of a levei for which you
have spell slots.

CAREFUL SPELL

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make
a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures
from the spell's full force. To do 50, you spend 1 sorcery

Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen
creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw
against the spell.
DISTANT SPELL

When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet ar
greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the
range of the spell.
When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you

spell 30 feel.
EMPOWERED SPELL

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1
sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up
to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Vou must
use the new rolls.
Vou can use Empowered Spell even if you have
already used a different Metamagic option during the
casting of the spell.

ar longer. you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its
duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting
time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

SORCEROUS RESTORATION

whenever you finish a short resl.

SORCEROUS

ORIGINS

Different sorcerers c1aim different origins for their
innate magic. Although many variations exist, most
of these origins fali into two categories: a draconic
bloodline and wild magic.

DRACONIC

BLOODLINE

Vour innate magic comes from draconic magic that was
mingled with your blood ar that of your ancestors. Most
often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent
back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a
bargain with a dragon ar who might even have c1aimed
a dragon parenl. Some of these bloodlines are well
established in the world, but most are obscure. Any
given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a
result of a pact ar some other exceptional circumstance.
DRAGON ANCESTOR

At 1st levei, you choose one type of dragon as your
ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon
is used by features you gain later.

SUBTLE SPELL

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to
cast it without any somatic ar verbal components.
TWINNED

SPELL

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and
doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of
sorcery points equal to the spell's levei to target a second
creature in range with the same spell (I sorcery point if
the spell is a cantrip).

ABILITY

SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th levei, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th levei, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, ar you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by I. As normal, you can't increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.

PART
102

I

I

CLASSES

Vou can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally,
whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting
with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it
applies to the check.
DRACONIC

RESILIENCE

As magic f10ws through your body, it causes physical
traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st levei,
your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by
1 again whenever you gain a levei in this c1ass.
Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin
sheen of dragon-Iike scales. When you aren't wearing
armar, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
ELEM ENTAL AFFIN ITY

Starting at 6th levei, when you cast a spell thal deals
damage of the type associated with your draconic
ancestry, add your Charisma modifier to that damage.
At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain
resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

DRAGON WINGS

At 14th levei, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of
dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed
equal to your current speed. You can create these wings
as a bonus action on your turno They last until you
dismiss them as a bonus action on your turno
You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor
unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and
clothing not made to accommodate your wings might
be destroyed when you manifest them.
DRACONIC

PRESENCE

Beginning at 18th leveI, you can channel the dread
presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around
you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action,
you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power
and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a
distance of 60 feel. For I minute or until you lose your
concentration (as if you were casting a concentration
spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this
aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose
fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on
this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.
WILD MAGIC
Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos
that underlie the order of creation. You might have
endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps
through a planar portalleading to Limbo, the Elemental
Planes, or lhe mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you
were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked bya
demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with
no apparent cause or reason. However it carne to be, this
chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlel.
WILD MAGIC SURGE

Starting when you choose this origin at 1st levei, your
spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic.
lmmediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st levei
or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a
I, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random
magical effect.
TIDES OF CHAOS

Starting at 1st levei, you can manipulate the forces of
chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll,
ability check, or saving throw. Once you do sO. you must
6nish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
Any time before you regain the use of lhis feature, the
DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table
immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of I st levei or
higher. You then regain the use of this feature.
BEND LUCK

Starting at 6th levei, you have the ability to twist fate
using your wild magic. When another creature you can
see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving
throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery
points to roll Id4 and apply the number rolled as a
bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You

can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects
of the roll occur.
CONTROLLED

CHAOS

At 14th levei, you gain a modicum of control over the
surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the
Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use
either number.
SPELL BOMBARDMENT

Beginning at 18th leveI, the harmful energy of your
spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and
roll the highest number possible on any of lhe dice,
choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to
the damage. You can use the feature only once per turno

WARLOCK
With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young
elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical
charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace
sentinel to his will.
As fiames spring to life in her hands, a wizened
human whispers the secret na me of her demonic patron,
infusing her spell with fiendish magic.
Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the
odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefiing
chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a
distant world,
Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies
hidden in the fabric of the multiverse, Through pacts
made with mysterious beings of supernatural power,
warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and
spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of
beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and
alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together
arcane secrets to bolster their own power,

SWORN AND BEHOLDEN
A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly
being, Sometimes the relationship between warlock
and patron is like that of a c1erie and a deity, though
the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not
gods, A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon
prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity-beings
not typically served by c1erics, More often, though, the
arrangement is similar to that between a master and
an apprentice, The warlock learns and grows in power,
at the cost of occasional services performed on the
patron's behalf.
The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor
but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as
the ability to see in darkness or to read any language)
to access to powerful spells, Unlike bookish wizards,
warlocks supplement their magic with some facility
at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light
armor and know how to use simple weapons,

DELVERS INTO SECRETS
Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge
and power, which compels them into their pacts and
shapes their lives, This thirst drives warlocks into their
pacts and shapes their later careers as well.
Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are
widely known, Sut many warlocks serve patrons that
are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds
comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord
or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully
aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of

CREATING

A WARLOCK

As you make your warlock character, spend some time
thinking about your patron and the obligations that
your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the
pact, and how did you make contact with your patron?
Wcrc you seduced into sumllloning a devi!, or did you
seek out the ritual thal would allow you to make contact
with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron,
or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe
under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in
anticipation of the rewards promised to you?
Work with your DM to determine how big a part your
pact will play in your character's adventuring career.

forbidden lore. a brilliant but crazed student's mind is
opened to realities beyond the material world and to the
alien beings lhat dwell in the outer void.
Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge
and power can't be slaked with mere study and research.
No one makes a pact with such a mighty palron if he or
she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather,
the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active
pursuit of their goals. which typically means some kind
of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their
patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.

Your patron's demands might drive you into adventures,
or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do
between adventures.
What kind of relationship do you have with your
patron? Is it friendly. antagonistic. uneasy. or romantic?
How important does your patron consider you to be?
What part do you play in your patron's plans? Do you
know other servants of your patron?
How does your patron communicate with you? If
you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with
your patron's voice. Some warlocks find messages
frolll their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea
leaves, or adrift in the clouds-messages
that only the
warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their
patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with
intermediaries.

and 19th leveI, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.

The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are
mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence-not
gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons
give their warlocks access to different powers and
invocations, and expect significant favors in returno
Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic
knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability
to bind mortaIs to their will. Other patrons bestow their
power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with
only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron
might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivaIs.

MYSTIC ARCANUM

THEARCHFEY

At 11th levei, your patron bestows upon you a magical
secret called an arca num. Choose one 6th-leveI spell
from the warlock spelllist as this arcanum.
Vou can cast your arca num spell once without
expending a spell slot. Vou must finish a long rest before
you can do so again.
At higher leveIs, you gain more warlock spells of your
choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th.level spell
at 13th leveI, one 8th.level spell at 15th levei, and one
9th-leveI spell at 17th leveI. Vou regain all uses of your
Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of
legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before
the mortal races were born. This being's motivations
are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and
might involve a striving for greater magical power or the
settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include
the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness,
ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer
Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam,
the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.

takes any damage.
DARK DELIRIUM

Starting at 14th leveI, you can plunge a creature into
an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature
that you can see within 60 feet of YOU.It must make a

(your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration
is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This
effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.
Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost
in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose.
The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and
the illusion.
Vou must finish a short or long rest before you can
use this feature again.
THE FIEND
Vou have made a pact with a fiend from the lower
planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil,
even if you strive against those aims. Such beings
desire the corruption or destruction of ali things,
ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to
forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon,
Orcus, Fraz'Urb-Iuu, and Baphomet; archdevils such
as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial;
pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and
ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.

damage as it reels from its horrific experience.

THE GREAT OLD ONE
Vour patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is
utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. It might come from
the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be
one of the elder gods known only in legends. [ts motives
are incomprehensible to mortaIs, and its knowledge so

WIZARD
Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an
elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the
battletield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving
in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a
tiny bead of tire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts
into a confiagration that engulfs the soldiers.
Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes
an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone
fioor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and
graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a
long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle,
bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly
plane beyond.
Crouching on the fioor in a dungeon intersection, a
gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with
mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over
them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly,
he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the
passage to his left.
Wizards are supreme magic-users, detined and united
as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle
weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast
spel1s of explosive tire, arcing lightning, subtle deception,
and brute.force mind control. Their magic conjures
monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the
future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest
spel1s change one substance into another, cal1 meteors
down from the sky, or open portaIs to other worlds.

SCHOLARS

OF THE ARCANE

Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the
power of magic draws students who seek to master
its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods,
shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical
spel1 requires merely the utterance of a few strange
words, fieeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or
clump of exotic materiaIs, these surface components
barely hint at the expertise attained after years of
apprenticeship and countless haurs of study.
Wizards live and die by their spel1s. Everything else
is secondary. They learn new spel1s as they experiment
and grow in experience. They can also learn them fram
other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions,
and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are
steeped in magic.

Creating a wizard character demands a backstory
dominated by at least one extraordinary
event. How
did your character first come into contact with magic?
How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do
you have a natural talent, or did you simply study
hard and practice incessantly?
Did you encounter a
magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the
basics of magic?
What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your
first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for
more? Have you received word of a secret repository
of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard?
Perhaps you're simply eager to put your newfound
magical skills to the test in the face of danger.

Wizards' lives are seldom mundane, The dosest a
wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working
as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching
others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell
their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or
pursue lives of crime or domination.
But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the
most unadventurous
wizards out of the safety of their
libraries and laboratories
and into crumbling ruins and
lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts
in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have
been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets
could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic
available in the present age.

Vou start with the following equipment, in addition to
the equipment granted by your baekground:

At 1st leveI. you have a spellbook eontaining six 1st-levei
wizard spells of your ehoice.

(a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger
(a) a eomponent poueh or (b) an areane foeus

SPELLBOOK

The spells that Vou add to your spellbook as Vou gain leveis
refiect the arcane research Vou conduct on your own, as well
as intellectual breakthroughs Vou have had about the nature
ofthe multiverse. You might find other spells during your
adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in
an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an
ancient library.
Copy;ng a Spell ;nlo lhe Book. When Vou find a wizard spell
of 1st levei or higher, Vou can add it to your spellbook if it is
of a levei for which Vou have spell slots and if Vou can spare
the time to decipher and copy il.
Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing
the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique
system of notation used by the wizard who wrote il. You
must practice the spell until Vou understand the sounds
or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook

SPELLCASTING

For each levei of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and
costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components Vou
expend as Vou experiment with the spell to master it, as well
as the fine inks Vou need to record il. Once Vou have spent
this time and money, Vou can prepare the spell just like your
other spells.
Replacing lhe Book. You can copy a spell from your own
spellbook into another book-for example, if Vou want
to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like
copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier,
since Vou understand your own notation and already know
how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp
for each levei of the copied spell.
If Vou lose your spellbook, Vou can use the same procedure
to transcribe the spells that Vou have prepared into a new
spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook
requires Vou to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this
reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.

ANO CASTING

The Wizard lable shows how many spell slots you have
to east your spells of 1st leveI and higher. To east one of
these spells, you must expend a slol of the spelJ's leveI
or higher. Vou regain ali expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
Vou prepare the Iist of wizard spells that are available
for you to east. To do so, ehoose a number of wizard
spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligenee
modifier + your wizard leveI (minimum of one spell). The
spells must be of a leveI for whieh you have spell slots.
For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have
four 1st-leve! and two 2nd-levei spell slots. With an
lntelligenee of 16, your list of prepared spells ean

Vou ean ehange your list of prepared spells when

memorizing the ineantations and gestures you must
make to east the spell: aI least 1 minute per spelllevel

ARCANE

RECOVERY

Vou have learned to regain some of your magical energy
by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you
finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots
to recover. The spell slots can have a combined leveI that
is equal to or less than half your wizard leveI (rounded
up), and none of the slots can be 6th leveI or higher.
For example, ifyou're a 4th-leveI wizard, you can recover
up to two leveIs worth of spell slots. Vou can recover either
a 2nd-leveI spell slot or two 1st-levei spell slots.

ARCANE TRADITION
When you reach 2nd levei, you choose an arcane
tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one
of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Oivination,
Enchantment, Evocation, lllusion, Necromancy,
or Transmutation, ali detailed at the end of the
class description.
Your choice grants you features at 2nd leveI and again
at 6th, 10th, and 14th leveI.

ABILITY

SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th levei, and again at 8th, 12th. 16th,
and 19th leveI, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.

SPELL MASTERY
At 18th leveI, you have achieved such mastery over
certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a
1st-levei wizard spell and a 2nd.level wizard spell that
are in your spellbook. Vou can cast those spells at their
lowest leveI without expending a spell slot when you
have them prepared. 1£you want to cast either spell at a
higher leveI, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one
or both of the spells you chose for different spells of
the same leveIs.

SIGNATURE

SPELLS

When you reach 20th levei, you gain mastery over two
powerful spells and can cast them with little effort.
Choose two 3rd.level wizard spells in your spellbook
as your signature spells. Vou always have these spells
prepared, they don't count against the number of spells
you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at
3rd leveI without expending a spell slot. When you do so,
you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
1£you want to cast either spell at a higher leveI, you
must expend a spell slot as normal.

ARCANE TRADITIONS
The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to
the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly
established in the worlds of 0&0, with various
traditions dedicated to its complex study.
The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse
revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through

the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping
them into eight categories called schools, as described
in chapter 10. In some places, these traditions are
literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of
lllusion while another studies across town at the School
of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are
more like academic departments, with rival faculties
competing for students and funding. Even wizards who
train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use
the division of magic into schools as a learning device,
since the spells of each school require mastery of
different techniques.

SCHOOL OF ABJURATION
The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks,
banishes, or protects. Oetractors of this school say
that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than
positive assertion. Vou understand, however, that ending
harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil
influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a
proud and respected vocation.
Called abjurers, members of this school are sought
when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important
locations must be guarded against magical spying, and
when portaIs to other planes of existence must be closed.
ABJURATION

SAVANT

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd leveI, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration
spell into your spellbook is halved.
ARCANE

WARD

Starting at 2nd levei, you can weave magic around
yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration
spell of I st leveI or higher, you can simultaneously use a
strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on
yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward
has hit points equal to twice your wizard leveI + your
Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the
ward takes the damage instead. lf this damage reduces
the ward to O hit points, you take any remaining damage.
While the ward has O hit points, it can't absorb
damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an
abjuration spell of 1st leveI or higher, the ward regains a
number of hit points equal to twice the leveI of the spell.
Once you create the ward, you can't create it again
until you finish a long resto
PROJECTED WARD

Starting at 6th leveI. when a creature that you can see
within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your
reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that
damage. If this damage reduces the ward to O hit points,
the warded creature takes any remaining damage.
IMPROVED

ABJURATION

Beginning at 10th leveI, when you cast an abjuration
spell that requires you to make an ability check as
a part of casting that spell (as in counterspell and
dispel magic), you add your proficiency bonus to lhat
ability check.

Starting at 6th leveI, you can use your action to teleport
up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.
Alternatively, you can choose a space within range
that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. ]f that

FOCUSED CONJURATION

Beginning at 10th leveI, while you are concentrating on
a conjuration spell, your concentration can't be broken
as a result of taking damage.
DURABLE SUMMONS

Starting at 14th leveI, any creature that you
summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30
temporary hit points.

SCHOOL OF DIVINATION
The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and
commoners alike, for ali seek a clearer understanding
of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive
to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so
that you can see clearly. Vou work to master spells of
discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge,
and foresight.
DIVINATION
SPELL RESISTANCE

Starting at 14th leveI, you have advantage on saving
throws against spells.
Furthermore, you have resistance against the
damage of spells.

SCHOOL OF CONJURATION
As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects
and creatures out of thin air. Vou can conjure billowing
clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from
elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery
grows, you learn spells of transportation and can
teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other
planes of existence, in an instan!.

glimpses of the future begin to press in on your
awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s
and record the numbers rolled. Vou can replace any
attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or
a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling
rolls. Vou must choose to do so before the roll, and you
can replace a roll in this way only once per turno
Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you
finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
EXPERT DIVINATION

Beginning at 6th leveI, casting divination spells comes
so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your
spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell
of 2nd leveI or higher using a spell slot, you regain one
expended spell slo!. The slot you regain must be of a
levellower than the spell you cast and can't be higher
than 5th leveI.

you can have it target a second creature.

GREATER PORTENT

ALTER MEMORIES

Starting at 14th levei, the visions in your dreams
intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind
of what is to come. Vou roll three d20s for your Portent
feature, rather than two.

At 14th levei, you gain the ability to make a creature
unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast
an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures,
you can alter one creature's understanding so that it
remains unaware of being charmed.
Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can
use your action lOtry to make the chosen creature
forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature
must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against
your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours
of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier
(minimum 1). Vou can make the creature forget less
time, and the amount of time can't exceed thc duration
of your enchantment spell.

SCHOOLOFENCHANTMENT
As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have
honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile
other people and monsters. Some enchanters are
peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their
arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others
are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their
service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between.

HYPNOTIC

GAZE

Starting at 2nd levei when you choose this school, your
soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall
another creature. As an action, choose one creature that
you can see within 5 feet of you. ]f the target can see or
hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you
until the end of your next turno The charmed creature's
speed drops to O, and the creature is incapacitated and
visibly dazed.
On subsequent turns, you can use your action to
maintain this effect, extending its duration until the
end of your next turno However, the effect ends if you
move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the
creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature
takes damage.
Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its
initial saving throw against this effect, you can't use this
feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.

SPLIT ENCHANTMENT

SCHOOL OF EVOCATION
Vou focus your study on magic that creates powerful
elemental effects sue h as bitter cold, searing flame,
rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid.
Some evokers find employment in military forces,
serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar.
Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak,
while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers,
or aspiring tyrants.
EVOCATION SAVANT

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd levei, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell

SCULPT SPELLS

Beginning at 2nd levei, you can create pockets of
reIative safety within the effects of your evocation spclls.
When you cast an evocation spell that affects other
creatures that you can see, you can choose a number
of them equal to 1 + the spell's leveI. The chosen
creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws
against the spell, and they take no damage if they would
normally take half damage on a successful save.

CHARM

Beginning at 6th levei, when a creature you can see
within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against
you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack,
provided that another creature is within the attack's
range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw
against your wizard spell save De. On a failed save,
the attacker must target the creature that is dosest
lo il, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures
are dosest, lhe attacker chooses which one to target.

POTENT

CANTRIP

Starting at 6th levei, your damaging cantrips affect
even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When
a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your
cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage (if
any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

Starting at 14th levei, you can increase the power of
your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of
5th levei ar lower that deals damage, you can deal
maximum damage with that spell.
The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect.
If you use this feature again before you finish a long
rest, you take 2d 12 necrotic damage for each levei of
the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you
use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the
necrotic damage per spelllevel increases by ldl2. This
damage ignores resistance and immunity.

SCHOOL OF ILLUSION
Vou focus your studies on magic that dazzles the
senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest
folk. Your magic is subtle, but the ilIusions crafted by
your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some
illusionists-including
many gnome wizards-are
benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain.
Others are more sinister masters of deception, using
their ilIusions to frighten and fool others for their
personal gain.

cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your

choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number
of cantrips known.
When you cast minar illusian, yau can create bath a
saund and an image with a single casting of the spell.
MALLEABLE

ILLUSIONS

Starting at 6th levei, when you cast an illusion spell that
has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use yaur
action to change the nature of that illusion (using the
spell's normal parameters for lhe illusion), provided that
you can see the illusion.
ILLUSORY SELF

Beginning at 10th levei, you can create an illusory
duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual
reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack
roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose
the illusory duplicate between the attacker and
yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the
ilIusion dissipates.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again untU
you finish a short ar long rest.
ILLUSORY REALITY

By 14th levei, you have learned the secret ofweaving
shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semireality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st levei or
higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical
object that is part of the illusion and make that object
real. Vou can do this on your turn as a bonus action
while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for
I minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a
bridge over a chasm and then make it reallong enough
for your allies to cross.
The object can't deal damage or otherwise
directly harm anyone.

SCHOOL OF NECROMANCY
The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces
of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in
this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that
animates allliving things. As you progress, you learn to
sap the life force fram a creature as your magic destrays
its bady, transforming that vital energy into magical
power you can manipulate.
Most people see necramancers as menacing, or even
villainous, due to the dose association with death.
Not all necramancers are evil, but the forces they
manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.

levei, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the
School of Necramancy. Vou don't gain this benefit for
killing constructs or undead.

UNDEAD THRALLS

At 6th levei, you add the animate dead spell to your
spellbook if it is not there already, When you cast
animate dead, you can target one additional corpse
or pile of bones, creating another zombie or ske1eton,
as appropriate,
Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy
spell, it has additional benefits:
The creature's hit point maximum is increased byan
amount equal to your wizard leveI.
The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its
weapon damage rolls,
INURED TO UNDEATH

Beginning at 10th levei, you have resistance to necrotic
damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced.
Vou have spent so much time dealing with undead and
the forces that animate them that you have become
inured to some of their worst effects.
COMMAND

UNDEAD

Starting at 14th levei, you can use magic to bring
undead under your control, even those created by other
wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that
you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must
make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard
spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature
on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and
obeys your commands until you use this feature again.
Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way.
If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has
advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving
throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can
repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it
succeeds and breaks free.

SCHOOL OF TRANSMUTATION
Vou are a student of spells that modify energy and matler.
To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently
mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change.
Vou wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both
physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives
you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge.
Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters,
turning people into toads and transforming copper into
silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their
magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the
power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.
TRANSMUTATION

SAVANT

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd levei, the

spell into your spellbook is halved.
MINaR

ALCHEMY

Starting at 2nd levei when you select this school, you
can temporarily alter the physical properties of one
nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into
another. Vou perform a special alchemical procedure
on one object composed entire1y of wood, stone (but not
a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into
a different one of those materiais. For each 10 minutes

you spend performing the procedure, you can transform
up to I cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you
lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on
a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.
TRANSMUTER'S

STONE

Starting at 6th levei, you can spend 8 hours creating a
transmuter's stone that stores transmutation magic. Vou
can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another
creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice
as long as the stone is in the creature's possession.
When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the
following options:
Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described in
chapter 8
An increase to speed of lO feet while the creature is
unencumbered
Proficiency in Constitution saving throws
Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder
damage (your choice whenever you choose this
benefit)
Each time you cast a transmutation spell of I st levei
or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the
stone is on your person.
If you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous
one ceases to function.
SHAPECHANGER

At 10th levei, you add the polymorph spell to your
spellbook, if it is not there already. Vou can cast
polymorph without expending a spell slot. When you
do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a
beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.
Once you cast polymorph in this way, you can't do so
again until you finish a short or long rest, though you
can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.
MASTER TRANSMUTER

Starting at 14th levei, you can use your action to
consume the reserve of transmutation magic slored
within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When
you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your
transmuter's stone is destroyed and can'l be remade
until you finish a long rest.
M'lÍor Transfarmatian. Vou can transmute one
nonmagical object-no larger than a 5.fool cube-inlo
another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and
of equal or lesse r value. Vou must spend 10 minutes
handling the object lOlransform it.
Panacea. Vou remove ali curses, diseases, and poisons
affecting a crealure that you touch with the transmuter's
stone. The creature also regains ali its hit points.
Restare Life. Vou cast the raise dead spell on a
creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, without
expending a spell si 01 or needing to have the spell in
your spellbook.
Restare Yauth. Vou touch the transmuter's stone to
a willing creature, and that creature's apparent age is
reduced by 3dlO years, to a minimum of 13 years. This
effect doesn't extend lhe creature's lifespan.
