with buyers and sellers of many sorts:
dwarf smiths and elf woodcarvers, halfling
farmers and gnome jewelers, not to mention
humans of every shape, size, and color
drawn fram a spectrum of nations and
cultures. In the largest cities, almost
anything imaginable is offered for sale, fram exotic
spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets and
practical swords.
For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons,
backpacks, rape, and similar goods is of paramount
importance, since praper equipmenl can mean lhe
difference belween life and dealh in a dungeon or the
unlamed wilds. This chapter delails the mundane and
exolic merchandise lhal adventurers commonly find useful
in lhe face of lhe lhreats lhal the worlds of 0&0 present.

STARTING EQUIPMENT

Members of lhe nobilily lrade eilher in legal righls, such
as lhe righls lo a mine, a porl, or farmland, or in gold
bars, measuring gold by lhe pound ralher than by lhe
coin. Only merchanls, advenlurers, and lhose offering
prafessional services for hire commonly deal in coins.

COINAGE
Common coins come in several differenl denominalions
based on lhe relalive worlh of the melai fram which lhey
are made. The lhree mosl common coins are lhe gold
piece (gp), lhe silver piece (sp), and lhe copper piece (cp).
Wilh one gold piece, a character can buy a belt
pouch, 50 feel of good rape, or a goat. A skilled (bUl
nol exceplional) arlisan can earn one gold piece a day.
The gold piece is lhe slandard unil of measure for
weallh, even if lhe coin ilself is nol commonly used.
When merchanls discuss deals lhal involve goods or
services worlh hundreds or thousands of gold pieces,
lhe lransaclions don'l usually involve lhe exchange of
individual coins. Ralher, lhe gold piece is a standard
measure of value, and lhe aclual exchange is in gold
bars, letters of credil, or valuable goods.
One gold piece is worlh len silver pieces, the mosl
prevalenl coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a
laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's
rest in a poor inn.
One silver piece is worlh len copper pieces, which are
common among laborers and beggars. A single copper
piece buys a candle, a lorch, or a piece of chalk.
In addition, unusual coins made of other precious
metais somelimes appear in lreasure hoards. The
eleclrum piece (ep) and lhe plalinum piece (pp) originale
from fallen empires and losl kingdoms, and lhey
sometimes arause suspicion and skepticism when used
in lransactions. An eleclrum piece is worth five silver
pieces, and a plalinum piece is worlh len gold pieces.
A standard coin weighs about a lhird of an ounce,
so fifty coins weigh a pound.

SELLING TREASURE
Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment,
weapons, armar, and more in the dungeons you explore.
Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when
you return to a town ar other setllement, provided that you
can find buyers and merchants interested in your 1001.
Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment. As a general
rule, undamaged weapons, armar, and other equipment
fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons
and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough
condition to sell.
Magic Items. Selling magic items is prablematic.
Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn't toa
hard, but other ilems are out of the realm of most but the
wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside fram a few common
magic items, you won't normally come across magic
items ar spells to purchase. The value of magic is far
beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.
Gems,jewe1ry, and Art Objects. These items retain
their full value in the marketplace, and you can either
trade them in for coin ar use them as currency for other
lransactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the
DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town ar
larger community first.
Trade Goods. On the borderlands, many people
conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art
objects, trade goods-bars of iran, bags of salt, Iivestock,
and so on-relain lheir full value in the market and can
be used as currency.

ARMOR AND SHIELDS
D&D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many
different cultures, each with its own technology leveI.
For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety
of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain
mail to costly plate armar, with several other kinds of
armor in between. The Armor table collects the most
commonly available types of armar found in the game
and separates them into three calegories: light armor,
medium armar, and heavy armar. Many warriors
supplement their armar with a shield.

••

VARIANT:

PART 1

I

EQUIPMENT

LIGHTARMOR
Made fram supple and thin materiais, light armor favors
agile adventurers since it offers some pratection without
sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armar, you add
your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your
armar type to determine your Armar Class.
Padded. Padded armar consists of quilted layers of
cloth and batting.
Leather. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of
this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened
by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armar is made of
softer and more flexible materiaIs.
Studded Leather. Made from tough but flexible
leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set
rivets ar spikes .

MEDIUM ARMOR

In most campaigns, you can use ar wear any equipment that
you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common
sense. For example, a burly haif.orc won't fit in a halfling's
leather armar, and a gnome would be swallowed up in a
c10ud giant's elegant robe.
The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of
plate armar made for one human might not fit another one
without significant alterations, and a guard's uniform mighl
be visibly ill.fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a
disguise.
Using this variant, when adventurers find armar, c1othing.
and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need
to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, ar similar exper!
to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies
from 10 to 40 percent ofthe market price ofthe item. The
DM can either rollld4 x 10 ar determine the increase in cost
based on the extent of the alterations required.
••••
---------------------

The Armar table shows the cost, weight, and other
properties of the common lypes of armor worn in the
worlds of D&D.
Armor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit of armar
ar strap a shield to an armo Only those praficient in the
armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however.
Your class gives you praficiency with certain types of
armor.lfyou wear armor that you lack proficiency with,
you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving
thraw, ar atlack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity,
and you can't cast spells.
Armor Class (AC). Armar protects its wearer fram
atlacks. The armar (and shield) you wear determines
your base Armar Class.
Heavy Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the
wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely.
lf the Armor table shows "Str 13" ar "Str 15" in the
Strength column for an armar type, the armar reduces
the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a
Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.
Stealth. lf the Armar table shows "Disadvanlage" in
the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Shields. A shield is made fram wood ar metal and
is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases
your Armar Class by 2. Vou can benefit from only one
shield at a time.

r
•.

Medium armar offers more pratection than light armar,
but il also impairs movement more.lfyou wear medium
armor, you add your Dexlerity modifier, to a maximum
of +2, to the base number fram your armor type to
determine your Armar Class.
Hide. This crude armor consists of thick furs and
pelts. lt is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil
humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools
and materiaIs needed lOcreate betler armor.
Chain Shirt. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain
shirl is worn belween layers of clothing ar leather. This
armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper
body and allows lhe sound of the rings rubbing against
one another to be muffled by outer layers.
ScaleMail.This armar consists of a coat and leggings
(and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with

overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a
fish, The suit includes gauntlets,
Breastp/ate. This armor consists of a fitted metal
chest piece worn with supple leather, Although it leaves
the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor
provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs
while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered,
Ha/fP/ate. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates
that cover most of the wearer's body, 1tdoes not include
leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached
with leather straps.

HEAVY ARMOR
Of al1 the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best
protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body
and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only
proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.
Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity
modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't
penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is nega tive.
Ring Mail. This armor is leather armor with heavy
rings sewn into it. The rings he1p reinforce the armor
against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is
inferior to chain mail, and it"s usual1y worn only by those
who can't afford better armor.
Chain Mail. Made of interlocking metal rings, chain
mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath
themail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of
blows. The suit includes gauntlets.
Splint. This armor is made of narrow vertical strips
of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over
c10th padding. Flcxible chain mail protects the joints.
P/ate. Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal
plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes
gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and
thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles
and straps distribute the weight over the body.

a longbow, your weapon and your abilily lo wield il
effeclively can mean lhe difference belween tife and

The Weapons lable shows lhe mosl common weapons

properlies lhey possesso Every weapon is classified
as eilher melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used lo
attack a largel wilhin 5 feel of you, whereas a ranged
weapon is used lo attack a largel aI a dislance.

WEAPON PROFICIENCY
Your race, class, and feals can granl you proficiency
wilh cerlain weapons or calegories of weapons. The lwo
calegories are simple and martial. Mosl people can
use sim pIe weapons wilh proficiency. These weapons
include clubs, maces, and olher weapons oflen found in
lhe hands of commoners. Marlial weapons, including
swords, axes, and polearms, require more speciatized
lraining lOuse effeclively. Mosl warriors use marlial
weapons because lhese weapons pul their fighling slyle

Proficiency wilh a weapon allows you lo add your

WEAPON PROPERTIES
Many weapons have special properlies relaled lo lheir use,
as shown in lhe Weapons lable.
Ammunition. Vou can use a weapon lhal has lhe

you have ammunilion lo fire from lhe weapon. Each
time you atlack wilh lhe weapon, you expend one piece
of ammunilion. Orawing lhe ammunition from a quiver,

PART I

I

EQUIPMENT

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property
to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an
improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in
the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage
when used in this way.
Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse
weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or
Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. Vou
must use the same modifier for both rolls.
Heavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack
rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and
bulk make it toa large for a Small creature to use
effectively.
Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle,
making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.
Loading. Because of the time required to load this
weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition
from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction
to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can
normally make.
Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged
attack has a range shown in parentheses after the
ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two
numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet,
and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range.
When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have
disadvantage on the attack rol I. Vou can't attack a target
beyond the weapon's long range.
Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when
you attack with it.
Special. A weapon with the special property has
unusual rules governing its use, explained in the
weapon's description (see "Special Weapons" later in
this section).
Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you
can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the
weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability
modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you
would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For
example, ifyou throw a handaxe, you use your Strength,
but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your
Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the
finesse property.
Two.Handed. This weapon requires two hands to use.
Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two
hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the
property-the damage when the weapon is used with
two hands to make a melee attack.

WEAPONS

Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and
have to attack with whatever is dose at hand. An
improvised weapon indudes any object you can wield
in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a
frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.
In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar
to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For
example, a table leg is akin to a dub. At the DM's option.
a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar

object as if it were that weapon and use his or her
proficiency bonus.

/-

PART 1

EQUIPMENT

147

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon
deals ld4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type
appropriate to the object). Ir a characler uses a ranged
weapon lo make a melee atlack, or throws a melee
weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also
deals ld4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a
normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
SILVERED WEAPONS

Some monsters that have immunity or resistance
to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver
weapons, so caulious adventurers invest extra coin to
plate their weapons with silver. Vou can silver a single
weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This
cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the
time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon
without making it less effective.
SPECIAL WEAPONS

Weapons with special rules are described here.
Lance. Vou have disadvantage when you use a lance
to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance
requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.
Net. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is
restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on

EQUIPMENT

creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge
or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10
Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within
its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the
net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it,
ending the effect and destroying the net.
When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction
to atlack with a net, you can make only one attack
regardless of the number of attacks you can
normally make.

AnVENTURING

GEAR

This section describes items that have special rules or
require further explanation.
Acid. As an action, you can splash the contents of
this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw
the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either
case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object,
treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the
target takes 2d6 acid damage.
Alchemist's Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites
when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this
flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a
ranged attack against a creature or object, treating

A to01helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise
do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or
pick a lock. Your race, c1ass, background, or feats give
you proficiency with certa in tools. Proficiency with a to01
allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability
check you make using that tool. Too! use is not tied to
a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents
broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM
might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine
detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check
to make something out of particularly hard wood.

MOUNTS

AND VEHICLES

A good mount can help you move more quickly through
the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the
gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts
and Other Animais table shows each animal's speed and
base carrying capacity.
An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled,
or wagon can move weight up to tive times its base
carrying capacity, inc1uding the weight of the vehic1e.
If multiple animais pull the same vehic1e, they can add
their carrying capacity together.
Mounts other than those listed here are available in
the worlds of 0&0, but they are rare and not normally
available for purchase. These inc1ude flying mounts
(pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animaIs) and
even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example).
Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg
and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with
a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.
Barding. Barding is armor designed to protect an
animal's head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of
armor shown on the Armor table in this chapter can
be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the
equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs
twice as much.
SaddJes. A military saddle braces the rider, helping
you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. 1t
gives you advantage on any check you make to remain
mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any
aquatic or flying mount.
VehicJe Proficiency. Ifyou have proticiency with a
certain kind of vehic1e (land or water), you can add your
proticiency bonus to any check you make to control that
kind of vehic1e in difficult circumstances.
Rowed Vesse1s. Keelboats and rowboats are used OH
lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of
the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of

55

lhe vehicle. These vehicles can'l be rowed againsl any
significanl currenl, bUllhey can be pulled upslream
by drafl animais on lhe shores. A rowboal weighs 100
pounds, in case advenlurers carry il over land.

risk of altracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might
help you avoid criminais, but you are unlikely lo make

Wretehed. Vou live in inhumane conditions. With
no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can,
sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying
on the goad graces of people better off than you. A
wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence,
disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other
wretched people cavet your armor, weapons, and
adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their
standards. Vou are beneath the notice of most people.
SquaJid. Vou live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut
just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house
in the worst part of town. Vou have shelter from the
elements, but you live in a desperate and often vialent
environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and
misfortune. Vou are beneath the notice of most people,
and you have few legal protections. Most people at
this lifestyle levei have suffered some terrible setback.
They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer
from disease.
Poor. A poor lifestyle means going without the
comforts available in a stable community. Simple food
and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable
conditions result in a sufficient, though probably
unpleasant, experience. Vour accommodations might
be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above
a tavern. Vou benefit from some legal protections,
but you still have to contend with violence, crime,
and disease. People at this lifestyle levei tend to be
unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves,
mercenaries, and other disreputable types.
Modest. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums
and ensures that you can maintain your equipment.
Vou live in an 01der part of town, renting a room in a
boarding house, inn, or temple. Vou don't go hungry or
thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple.
Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers
with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards,
and the like.

ComfortabJe. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle
means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily
maintain your equipment. Vou live in a small cottage
in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room
at a fine inn. Vou associate with merchants, skilled
tradespeople, and military officers.
Wea1thy. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a
life of !uxury, though you might not have achieved the
social status associated with the old money of nobility
or royalty. Vou live a lifestyle comparable to that of a
highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the
royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. Vou
have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in
a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn.
Vou likely have a small staff of servants.
Aristoeratie. Vou live a life of plenty and comfort. Vou
move in circles populated by the most powerful people
in the community. Vou have excellent lodgings, perhaps
a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the
finest inn. Vou dine at the best restaurants, retain the
most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants
attending to your every need. Vou receive invitations
to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and
spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild
leaders, high priests, and nobility. Vou must also
contend with the highest leveIs of deceit and treachery.
The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will
be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.

SERVICES
Advenlurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them
or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most
such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others
are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with
specialized adventuring skills.
Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on
the Services table. Other common hirelings include
any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical
town or city, when the adventurers pay them to
perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might
paya carpenter to conslruct an elaborale chest (and
ils miniature replica) for use in the Leomund's secret
chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmilh to
forge a special sword. A bard mighl pay a tailor lo make
exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in
front of the duke.
Olher hirelings provide more expert or dangerous
services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the
advenlurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as
are sages hired to research ancient or esoleric lore. If a
high-Ievel adventurer establishes a stronghold of some
kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and
agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward
to meniallaborers lo keep the stables clean. These
hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes
a place to live within lhe stronghold as part of the
offered compensation.

Skilled hirelings include anyone hired lo perform a
service that involves a proficiency (including weapon,
tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on.
The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings
require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for
menial work that requires no particular skill and can
include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.

SPELLCASTING

SERVICES

People who are able to cast spells don't fali into the
category of ordinary hirelings. lt might be possible to
find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin
or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay
rates exisl. As a rule, the higher the leveI of the desired
spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast il
and the more it costs.
Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell
of 1st or 2nd levei, such as cure wounds or identify, is
easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50
gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material
components). Finding someone able and wiHing to
cast a higher-Ievel spell might involve traveling to a
large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent
temple. Once found, lhe spellcaster might ask for a
service instead of payment-the kind of service that
only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving arare
item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monsterinfested wilderness to deliver somelhing important to
a distant settlemenl.

TRINKETS
When you make your character, you can roll once on
lhe Trinkets table to gain a trinket, a simple item lightly
touched by mystery. The DM might also use this table.
It can help stock a room in a dungeon or fiHa creature's
pockets.
