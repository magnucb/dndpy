CHAPTER
~

4:

PERSONALITY

HARACTERS ARE DEFINED BY MUCH MORE THAN

their race and c1ass. They're individuais with
their own stories, interests, connections, and
capabilities beyond those that c1ass and race
define. This chapter expounds on the details
that distinguish characters from one another,
including the basics of name and physical description,
the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer
points of personality and alignment.

CHARACTER

Your character's name and physical description might
be the first things that the other players at the table
learn about you. !t's worth thinking about how these
characteristics reflect the character you have in mind.

NAME
Your character's race description includes sample
names for members of that race. Put some thought into
your name even if you're just picking one from a list.

SEX
Vou can play a male or female character without gaining
any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how
your character does or does not conform to the broader
cu!ture's expectations of sex, gender, and sexual
behavior. For example, a male drow c1eric defies the
traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could
be a reason for your character to leave that society and
come to the surface.

CONTRASTING

CHARACTERS

The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting
your character apart from every other character. Consider the
following two human fighters.
Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a
brash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of
a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father's
trade on the streets of Solace. When she tried to rob the
proprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and
took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. Sut
when the dragonarmies laid waste to the town ofSolace
and destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into adventure
alongside the friends she'd known from her childhood. Her
skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one ofher favorite
weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her
skills invaluable in her adventuring career.
Artemis Entrer; grew up on the streets of Calimport in the
Forgotten Realms. He used his wits, strength, and agility
to carve out his own territory in one of the city's hundreds
of poor shanty towns. After several years, he attracted the
notice of one ofthe most powerful thieves' guilds in the city,
and he ascended the ranks ofthe guild quickly despite his
youth. Artemis became the favored assassin of one ofthe
city's pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale to recover
some stolen gems. He's a professional killer, constantly
challenging himselfto improve his skills.
Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with
some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high
Strength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends.

••

Vou don't need to be confined to binary notions of
sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often
seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic, for example,
and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon's
image. Vou could also play a female character who
presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a
female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being
mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character's sexual
orientation is for you to decide.

HEIGHT

DETAILS

•••

AND BACKGROUND

AND WEIGHT

Vou can decide your character's height and weight,
using the information provided in your race description
or on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about
what your character's ability scores might say about his
or her height and weight. A weak but agile character
might be thin. A strong and tough character might be
tall or just heavy.
If you want to, you can roll randomly for your
character's height and weight using the Random Height
and Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height
Modifier column determines the character's extra
height (in inches) beyond the base height. That same
number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in
the Weight Modifier column determines the character's
extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.

For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8

a total of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches tal I. Then
the player uses that same roll of 12 and multiplies it by
2d4 pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra
36 pounds (12 x 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a
total of 146 pounds.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Vou choose your character's age and the color of

exotic land and carries a more mysterious name.

Tika is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring

and a mole on her right hip. Artemis is a small man, compact

...•..---------------------ALIGNMENT

A typical creature in the worlds of DUNGEONS&
DRAGONShas an alignment, which broadly describes
its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a
combinalion of two factors: one identifies morality
(good, evil, or neutra I), and the olher describes
altitudes toward society and order (Iawful, chaotie,
or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the
possible combinations.
These brief summaries of the nine alignments
describe the typical behavior of a creature with that
alignment. Individuais might vary significantly from
that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and
consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.
Lawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do
the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons,
paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.
Neutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help
others according to their needs. Many celestiais, some
e10ud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.
Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience
directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper
dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotie good.
Lawful neutra I (LN) individuais act in accordance
with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and
some wizards are lawful neutra!.
Neutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to
steer e1ear of moral questions and don't take sides,

SAMPLE

ALIGNMENT

IN THE MULTIVERSE

For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral
choice. Humans, dwarves, e1ves, and other humanoid
races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or
evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned
gods who created these races gave them free will to
choose their moral paths, knowing that good without
free will is slavery.
The evil deities who created other races, though, made
those races to serve them. Those races have strong
inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods.
Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc
god, Gruumsh. and are thus inelined toward evil. Even if
an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its
innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel
the lingering pull of the orc god's influence.)
Alignment is an essential pari of the nature of
celestiaIs and fiends. A devil does not choose to be
lawful evil, and it doesn't tend toward lawful evil, but
rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow
ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.
Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational
thought do nol have alignments-they
are unaligned.
Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or
ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature.
Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are
not evil; they have no alignment.

PERSONALlTY

Tika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted
and striving to help others where she cano Artemis is lawful
evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least
professional in his approach to murder.
As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer. He
began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with heroes
when he must-and when it's in his own best interests. In
most games, evil adventurers cause problems in groups
alongside others who don't share their interests and objectives.
Generally, evil alignments are for villains and monsters.

Your race indicates the languages your character can
speak by default, and your background
might give you
access to one or more additionallanguages
Df your
choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.
Choose your languages from the Standard Languages
table, or choose one that is common in your campaign.
With your DM's permission,
you can instead choose a
language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret
language, such as thieves' cant or the tongue Df druids.
Some Df these languages are actually families
Df languages with many dialects. For example, the
Primordiallanguage
includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan,
and Terran dialects, one for each Df the four elemental
planes. Creatures that speak different dialects Df the
same language can communicate
with one another.

TRAITS

Give your character two personality traits. Personality
traits are small, simple ways to help you set your
character apart from every other character. Your
personality traits should tell you something interesting
and fun about your character. They should be self.
descriptions
that are specific about what makes your
character stand out. "I'm smart" is not a good trait,
because it describes a lot Df characters.
"!'ve read every
book in Candlekeep"
tells you something specific about
your character's
interests and disposition.
Personality
traits might describe the things your
character likes, his or her past accomplishments,
things
your character dislikes or fears, your character's
sei fattitude or mannerisms,
or the influence Df his or her
ability scores.

CHARACTERISTICS

Fleshing out your character's
personality-the
array Df

habits, beliefs, and flaws that give
a person a unique identity-will
help you bring him

characteristics
are presented here: personality traits,
ideais, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories,
think about your character's
favorite words or phrases,
tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and
whatever else you can imagine.
Each background

CHARACTERISTICS

IDEALS

Tika and Artemis have distinct personality traits. Tika Waylan
dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights resulting
from a bad fali during her career as a thief. Artemis Entreri
is always prepared for the worst and moves with a quick,
precise confidence.
Consider their ideais. Tika Waylan is innocent, almost
childlike, believing in the value oflife and the importance of
appreciating everyone. Neutral good in alignment, she c1eaves
to ideais of life and respec!. Artemis Entreri never allows
his emotions to master him, and he constantly challenges
himself to improve his skills. His lawful evil alignment gives
him ideais of impartiality and a lust for power.
Tika Waylan's bond is to the Inn ofthe Last Home. The
inn's proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and her
friendship with her adventuring companions was forged
during her time working there. Its destruction by the
marauding dragonarmies
gives Tika a very personal reason to
hate them with a fiery passion. Her bond might be phrased
as "I will do whatever it takes to punish the dragonarmies for
the destruction ofthe Inn ofthe Last Home."
Artemis Entreri's bond is a strange, almost paradoxical
relationship with Drizzt Do'Urden, his equal in swordplay
and grim determination.
In his first battle with Drizzt,
Artemis recognized something of himself in his opponent,
some indication that if his life had gone differently, he
might have led a life more like the heroic drow's. From that
moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin-he

Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideais
are the things that you believe in most strongly, the
fundamental moral and ethical principies that compel you
to act as you do. Ideais encompass everything from your
life goals to your core belief system.
Ideais might answer any of these questions: What are
the principies that you will neve r betray? What would
prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act
and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single
most important thing you strive for?
Vou can choose any ideais you like, but your
character's alignment is a good place to start defining
them. Each background in this chapter includes six
suggested ideais. Five of them are linked to aspects of
alignment: law, chaos, good, evit, and neutrality. The last
one has more to do with the particular background than
with moral or ethical perspectives.
BONDS

Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a
character's connections to people, places, and events in
the world. They tie you to things from your background.
They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead
you to act against your own best interests if they are
threatened. They can work very much like ideaIs,
driving a character's motivations and goals.
Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do
you care most about? To what place do you feeI a special
connection? What is your most treasured possession?
Your bonds might be tied to your c1ass, your
background, your race, or some other aspect of your
character's history or personality. Vou might also gain
new bonds over the course of your adventures.

is an

antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizz!. His bond might be
phrased as "I will not rest untill have proved myselfbetter
than Drizzt Do'Urden."
Each of these characters also has an important flaw.
Tika Waylan is naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger
than her companions and annoyed that they still think
of her as the kid they knew years ago. She might even be
tempted to act against her principies if she's convinced that
a particular achievement would demonstrate
her maturity.
Artemis Entreri is completely walled offfrom any personal
relationship and just wants to be left alone.

~

FLAWS

,.

Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your
character's flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear,
or weakness-in particular, anything that someone
e1se could exploit to bring you to ruin ar cause you to
act against your best interests. More significant than
nega tive personality traits, a flaw might answer any
of these questions: What enrages you? What's the one
person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What
are your vices?

A useful place to start thinking about personality
traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores
and define one trait related to each. Either one could be
positive or nega tive: you might work hard to overcome a
low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.

INSPIRATION
Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to
reward you for playing your character in a way that's
true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw.
By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality
trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you
an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or
inspiration can let you calI on your bond to the defense
of your home village to push past the effect of a spelI
that has been laid on you.

GAINING

INSPIRATION

Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety
of reasons. TypicalIy, DMs award it when you play
out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks
presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your
character in a compelIing way. Your DM wilI telI you
how you can earn inspiration in the game.
Vou either have inspiration or you don't-you can't
stockpile multi pie "inspirations" for later use.

USING INSPIRATION
lf you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make
an attack rolI, saving throw, or ability check. Spending
your inspiration gives you advantage on that rol!.
AdditionalIy, if you have inspiration, you can reward
another player for good roleplaying, e1ever thinking,
or simply doing something exciting in the game.
When another player characler does somelhing that
realIy contributes to the story in a fun and interesting
way, you can give up your inspiration to give lhat
characler inspiration.

BACKGROUNDS
Every story has a beginning. Your character's
background reveals where you carne from, how you
beca me an adventurer, and your place in the world.
Your tighter might have been a courageous knight or a
grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or
an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild
thief or commanded audiences as a jester.
Choosing a background provides you with important
story cues about your character's identity. The most
important question to ask about your background is
what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your
background describes and start adventuring? Where
did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or,
if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you
have more money? How did you learn the skills of your
e1ass? What sets you apart from ordinary people who
share your background?

As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who
share your faith, and you can perform the religious
ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring
companions can expect to receive free healing and
care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence
of your faith, though you must provide any material
components needed for spells. Those who share
your religion will support you (but only you) at a
modest lifestyle.
Vou might also have ties to a specific tem pIe dedicated
to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a
residence there, This could be the temple where you
used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a
temple where you have found a new home, While near
your temple. you can call upon the priests for assistance.
provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and
you remain in good standing with your temple.
SUGGESTED

CHARACTERISTICS

Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples
or other religious communities. Their study of the
history and tenets of their faith and their relationships
to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their
mannerisms and ideaIs. Their flaws might be some
hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond
taken to an extreme.

CHARLATAN

d8

Vou have always had a way with people. Vou know
what makes them tick. you can tease out their hearts'
desires after a few minutes of conversation,
and with a
few leading questions you can read them like they were
children's books. !t's a useful talent, and one that you're
perfectly willing to use for your advantage.
Vou know what people want and you deliver. or rather,
you promise to deliver. Common sense should steer
people away from things that sound toa good to be true,
but common sense seems to be in short supply when
you're around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will
surely cure that unseemly rash, this ointment-nothing
more than a bit of fat with a sprinkle of silver dust-can
restore youth and vigor, and there's a bridge in the city
thatjust happens to be for sale. These marvels sound
implausible, but you make them sound like the real dea!.

VARIANT CRIMINAL:

Although your capabilities are not much different
from those of a burglar or smuggler, you learned
and practiced them in a very different context: as an
espionage agenl. Vou might have been an officially
sanctioned agent of the crown, or perhaps you sold the
secrets you uncovered to the highest bidder.

Vou thrive in front of an audience. Vou know how to
entrance them, entertain them, and even inspire them.
Your poetics can stir the hearts of those who hear you,
awakening grief or joy, laughter or anger. Your music
raises their spirits or captures their sorrow. Your dance
steps captivate, your humor cuts to the quick. Whatever
techniques you use, your art is your life.

Routine

FEATURE: By POPULAR DEMAND

Vou can always find a place to perform, usually in an
inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or
even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free
lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard
(depending on the quality of the establishment), as
long as you perform each night. In addition, your
performance makes you something of a local figure.
When strangers recognize you in a town where you have
performed, they typically take a liking to you.
SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS

Successful entertainers have to be able to capture
and hold an audience's attention, so they tend to
have flamboyant or forceful personalities. They're
inclined toward the romantic and often cling to
high-minded ideaIs about the practice of art and the
appreciation of beauty.

A gladiator is as much an entertainer as any minstrel
or circus performer, trained to make the arts of combat
into a spectacle the crawd can enjoy. This kind of
flashy combat is your entertainer routine, though you
might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor.
Using your By Popular Demand feature, you can find a
place to perform in any place that features combat for
entertainment-perhaps
a gladiatorial arena or secret
pit fighting club. Vou can replace the musical instrument
in your equipment package with an inexpensive but
unusual weapon, such as a trident or neto

you fit in among them with ease. Vou can find a place
to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners,
unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to
them. They will shield you from the law or anyone
else searching for you, though they will not risk
their lives for YOU.
SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS

A folk hero is one of the common people, for better
or for worse. Most folk heraes look on their humble
origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming, and their home
communities remain very important to them.

Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to
support several artisans practicing the same trade.
However, your guild might instead be a loose network
of artisans who each work in a different village within
a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the

MEMBERSHIP

As an established and respected member of a guild, you
can rely on certain benefits that membership provides.
Your fellow guild members will provide you with
lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral
if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a
central place to meet other members of your profession,
which can be a good place to meet potential patrons,
allies, or hirelings.
Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If
you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you
if a good case can be made for your innocence or the
crime isjustifiable. Vou can also gain access to powerful
political figures through the guild, if you are a member
in good standing. Such connections might require the
donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.
Vou must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If
you miss payments, you must make up back dues to
remain in the guild's good graces.

VARIANT

ARTISAN:

MERCHANT

Instead of an artisans' guild, you might belong to a
guild of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers. Vou
don't craft items yourself but earn a living by buying
and selling lhe works of others (or the raw materiaIs
artisans need to practice lheir craft). Your guild might
be a large merchant consortium (or family) with
interests across the region. Perhaps you transported
goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or
caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold
them in your own little shop. In some ways, the traveling
merchant's life lends itself to adventure far more than
the life of an artisan.
Rather lhan proficiency with artisan's tools, you might
be proficient with navigator's tools or an additional
language. And instead of artisan's tools, you can start
with a mule and a carl.

What was the reason for your isolation, and what
changed to allow you to end your solitude? Vou can work
with your DM to determine the exact nature of your
seclusion, or you can choose or roll on the table below to
determine the reason behind your seclusion.

FEATURE: DISCOVERY
The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you
access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact
nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your
seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos,
the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or
the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else
has ever seen. Vou might have uncovered a fact that has
long been forgotten, or unearthed
some reli c of the past
that could rewrite history. It might be information
that
would be damaging to the peopJe who or consigned you
to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.
Work with your DM to determine the details of your
discovery and its impact on the campaign.

SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Some hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion,
whereas others chafe against it and long for company.
Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it, the
solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideais. A few are
driven slightly mad by their years apart from society.

OTHER

HERMITS

This hermit background assumes a contempla tive sort
of seclusion that allows room for study and prayer. If you
want to play a rugged wilderness recluse who lives off
the land while shunning the company of other people,
look at the outlander background. On the other hand, if
you want to go in a more religious direction, the acolyte
might be what you're looking for. Or you could even be a
charlatan, posing as a wise and holy person and letting
pious fools support you.

NOBLE
Vou understand wealth, power, and privilege. Vou
carrya noble title, and your family owns land, collects
taxes, and wields significant political influence. Vou
might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with
work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated
to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a
disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be
an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply
about the people who live and work on your land, keenly
aware of your responsibility to them.
Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate
title and determine how much authority that title
carries. A noble title doesn't stand on its own-it's
connected to an entire family, and whatever title you
hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not
only do you need to determine your noble title, but you
should also work with the DM to describe your family
and their influence on you.
Is your family old and established, or was your title
only recently bestowed? How much influence do they
wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation

does your family have among the other aristocrats of the
region? How do the common people regard them?
What's your position in the family? Are you the hei r
to the head of the family? Have you already inherited
the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or
are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one
cares what you do, as long as you don't embarrass the
family? How does the head of your family feel about
your adventuring career? Are you in your family's good
graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?
Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you
might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear
all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your
line or even a spiritual member of the family?
These details help establish your family and your title
as features of the world of the campaign.
Skill Proficiencies: History, Persuasion

Equiprnent: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll

FEATURE:

POSITION

OF PRIVILEGE

Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to
think the best of you. Vou are welcome in high society,
and people assume you have the right to be wherever
you are. The common folk make every effort to
accommodate you and avoid your displeasurc, and other
people of high birth treal you as a member of the same
social sphere. Vou can secure an audience with a local
noble if you need to.
SUGGESTED

CHARACTERISTICS

Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle
than most people ever experience, and their personalities
reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a
plethora of bonds-responsibilities
to family, to other
nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted
to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this
responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

SAILOR
Vou sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that
time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the
deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the
bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line of
the horizan, but the time has come to try your hand
at something new.
Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed
with your Dungeon Master. Was it a merchant ship,
a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship?
How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it widely traveled?
Is it stiII sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost
with ali hands?
What were your duties on board-boatswain,
capta in,
navigator, cook, or some other position? Who were the
captain and first mate? Did you leave your ship on good
terms with your fellows, or on the run?
Skill Proficiencies:
Athletics, Perception
Tool Proficiencies:
Navigator's tools, vehides (water)
Equipment:
A belaying pin (dub), 50 feet of silk rope,
a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone
with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random
trinket on the Trinkets table in chapter 5), a set of
common dothes, and a belt pouch containing
10 gp
FEATURE: SHIP'S PASSAGE
When you need to, you can secure free passage on
a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring
companions.
Vou might sail on the ship you served on,
or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps
one captained bya former crewmate). Because you're
calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or
route that wiII meet your every need. Your Dungeon
Master wiII determine how long it takes to get where
you need to go. In return for your free passage, you
and your companions
are expected to assist the crew
during the voyage.
SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities
of
life on a ship make them generally reliable as welI. Life
aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most
important attachments.

URCHIN
Vou grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor.
Vou had no one to watch over you or to provide for
you, so you learned to provide for yourself. Vou fought
fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other
desperate souls who might steal from you. Vou slept on
rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and
endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or
a place to recuperate.
You've survived despi te ali odds,
and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some
combination
of each.
Vou begin your adventuring career with enough
money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days.
How did you come by that money? What allowed you to
break free of your desperate circumstances
and embark
on a better life?
Skill Proficiencies:
Sleight of Hand, Stealth
Tool Proficiencies:
Disguise kit, thieves' tools
Equiprnent:
A small knife, a map of the city you
grew up in, a pet mouse, a token to remember your
parents by, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch
containing
10 gp
FEATURE:

CITY SECRETS

Vou know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can
find passages through the urban sprawl that others would
miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions
you lead) can travei between any two locations in the city
twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.

SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Urchins are shaped by lives of desperate poverty, for
good and for ill. They tend to be driven either by a
commitment
to the people with whom they shared life
00 the street or by a burning
desire to find a better lifeand maybe get some payback on ali the rich people who
treated them badly.
