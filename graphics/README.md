Graphics for DnDpy
==================
Contents for all graphics until we figure out how this makes sense to us...

Raw
---
Folder for storing source-images that will be used to create further material.
Source-images do not belong to us, and we claim no ownership. We will however strive to detail the true owners of this material.

Logo
----
An effort in creating a cool, visually appealing, and representive (temporary) logo.

We have no idea how ownership and reusability is released legally with artworks,
but so far we assume that artwork is GNU (_explain details later_) and we're good as long as we don't make any profit.
