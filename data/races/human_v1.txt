### begin 'Names' here ###
Having so much more variety than other cultures,
humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human
parents give their children names from other languages,
such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less
correctly), but most parents give names that are linked
to their region's culture or lo the naming lraditions of
their ancestors.
The malerial cullure and physical characleristics
of humans can change wildly from region lo region.
In the Forgolten Realms, for example, lhe c101hing,
archileclure, cuisine, music, and Iilerature are different
in lhe norlhwestern lands of lhe Silver Marches than
in dislanl Turmish or Impillur to the easl-and even
more dislinclive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical
characleristics, lhough, vary according lOlhe ancient
migrations of lhe earliesl humans, so lhallhe humans
of the Silver Marches have every possible varialion of
coloralion and features.
In the Forgotten Realms, nine human elhnic groups
